      "text": "Thank you, Tejas, and good afternoon. Today we are proud to announce
      Apple''s biggest quarter ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time
      revenue record of nearly $124 billion, of 11% from last year, and better than
      we had expected at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that
      our active install base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8
      billion devices. We set all time records for both developed and emerging markets
      and saw revenue growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad,
      which we said would be supply constrained. As expected in the aggregate, we
      experienced supply constraints that were higher than the September quarter.
      Before I discuss our results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge
      the toll that COVID continues to have on communities around the world. In many
      places, case counts are higher and health systems more strained than at any
      point throughout the pandemic. On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend
      our deep gratitude to the scientists, doctors, nurses, and so many others on
      the front lines of combating COVID-19. This is our eighth quarter reporting
      results in the shadow of the pandemic. And while I can''t say it gets any easier,
      I can say I''m incredibly proud of the way our teams have come together and
      continue to innovate on behalf of our customers. A few weeks ago, we marked
      the 15th anniversary of the day Steve revealed iPhone to the world. We knew
      that we had the beginnings of something fundamentally transformative, though
      none of us could have predicted the incredible and meaningful impact it would
      have on all of our lives. The creative spirit that made the first iPhone possible
      has thrived at Apple every day since. We never stop creating. We never stop
      innovating. You can see that spirit reflected throughout our products, from
      the incredible performance and capability of our M1 chips, to our powerful yet
      easy to use operating systems, to our unrivaled iPhone camera systems, to the
      beauty and magic of AirPods. That''s why each of our major products leads the
      industry in customer satisfaction for their respective category. People expect
      Apple to solve hard problems with easy-to-use products. And iPhone has never
      been more popular. During the December quarter, we set an all-time revenue record
      for iPhone, thanks to the strength of our incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This
      is the best iPhone lineup we''ve ever had, and the reaction from the press and
      our users have been off the charts. This past quarter, we also set another all-time
      revenue record for Mac, with customers eager to get their hands on an M1-powered
      MacBook Air, iMac, or MacBook Pro. We''ve been thrilled with the response from
      Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max chips, and to see how Apple Silicon is blowing
      them away with its power, performance, and efficiency. Despite the constraints
      I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup continues to be indispensable to tens of
      millions of people, from teachers and students to artists and creators. Customers
      are eager to get their hands on our ninth generation iPad, which features a
      beautiful display and double the storage capacity, as well as the new iPad mini
      with its ultra portable design. Wearable home and accessories, meanwhile, set
      an all-time revenue record. Customers are loving the Apple Watch Series 7 with
      its cutting-edge health and fitness tracking features. Nearly every day, I get
      notes from customers who share how a heart alert led to a life-saving appointment
      with a cardiologist. And more recently, I''ve been hearing from people who tell
      me that their Apple Watch saved their lives by calling 911 when they couldn''t.
      As I''ve said, we''re still in the early innings with our health work, but every
      day I am encouraged by our positive impact. We are also making great advancements
      in audio and are seeing strong demand from customers as a result. The HomePod
      Mini continues to earn praise for combining the intelligence of Siri with an
      immersive, room-filling audio experience. And our customers have responded with
      a lot of excitement to the magic of spatial audio on AirPods, which packs the
      acoustics of a concert hall. As always, the deep integration of hardware, software,
      and services is a hallmark of everything Apple makes. It''s a principle you
      can see at work in the introduction of SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole
      new way to create shared experiences by letting users watch and listen to their
      favorite content together on FaceTime. And we continue to invest in innovation
      across our services business, which set another all-time revenue record last
      quarter and performed even better than we had anticipated. The App Store continues
      to be an economic miracle for developers around the world and a safe and trusted
      place for consumers to discover their favorite apps. Since its launch, we have
      paid developers selling digital goods and services more than $260 billion with
      2021 setting a new record for their earnings. I''m also happy to report that
      in its first two years, Apple TV Plus shows and movies have earned 200 award
      wins and more than 890 nominations. Among the powerful lineup are feature films
      like The Tragedy of Macbeth, Coda, and Swan Song, along with many gripping new
      series coming up, including Severance and The After Party. Each one is a tremendous
      credit to all the storytellers in front of the cameras and behind them who touched
      audiences all over the world. Fitness Plus, meanwhile, continues to inspire
      customers to reach their health and fitness goals. We recently introduced Time
      to Run, an extension of our popular series Time to Walk, as well as new collections
      of workouts and meditations to help users make more intentional training choices.
      Despite the pandemic, our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple''s
      history, and we also earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores. That
      is a testament to the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we''ve
      reimagined the retail experience. I also want to take a moment to thank our
      retail employees and AppleCare teams for the deep care you''ve given to our
      customers as they look to get the most out of our products, learn new skills,
      or track down the perfect gift. We have always led with our values and with
      compassion and care, and never has that been more needed than during the pandemic.
      Last quarter, we celebrated 10 years of our employee giving program, which we
      started to help our employees identify and support the causes they care most
      deeply about. We pledged to match their contributions to organizations doing
      important work at every level, from their local food pantry to global humanitarian
      nonprofits. In the last decade, this program has contributed nearly $725 million
      to charitable organizations. We also celebrated 15 years of Apple''s partnership
      with the Global Fund on Project Red, supporting their life-saving work to expand
      healthcare services in Sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV AIDS. With
      the support of our customers, we''ve now raised nearly $270 million to fund
      prevention, testing, and counseling services for people impacted by HIV AIDS.
      And in keeping with our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also
      launched a new partnership with the Boys and Girls Club of America. This initiative
      will help young people across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone
      Can Code curriculum. And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat
      climate change. We are already carbon neutral across our own operations and
      we are working intensely to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our
      supply chain and the life cycle of our products. To celebrate Black History
      Month, we will be releasing a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity braided
      solo look and a matching Unity lights watch face. And through our racial equity
      and justice initiative, we are continuing to support organizations blazing trails
      to a more equitable world in our economies, our classrooms, and our criminal
      justice system. We recognize, as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our
      most profound challenges, and at Apple we are determined to do our part. That
      includes our own work in inclusion and diversity, which we are advancing every
      day. Let me close by saying that despite the uncertainty of the world, there
      is one thing of which I am certain. Apple will continue to innovate every day
      and in every way to deliver on the promise of technology at its best. I will
      now turn it over to Luca to go over our quarterly results in more detail."},
      {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.
      We are very pleased to report record financial results for the December quarter.
      We set an all-time revenue record of 123.9 billion, an 11% increase from a year
      ago. We reached new all-time records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
      and the rest of Asia Pacific. and it was also an all-time record quarter for
      both products and services. On the product side, revenue was 104.4 billion,
      up 9% over a year ago, despite significant supply constraints. We grew in each
      of our product categories, except iPad, where supply constraints were particularly
      pronounced, and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, and wearables, home, and
      accessories. The strong level of sales performance, the unmatched loyalty of
      our customers, and the strength of our ecosystem have driven our current installed
      base of active devices to a new all-time record of 1.8 billion devices. The
      growth in this stored base was broad-based, as we set all-time records in each
      major product category and in each geographic segment. Our services set an all-time
      revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24% over a year ago, with December quarter
      records in every geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.8%, up 160
      basis points from last quarter, due to volume leverage and favorable mix, partially
      offset by higher cost structures. Products gross margin was 38.4%, up 410 basis
      points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 72.4%,
      up 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income
      of $34.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10, both grew more than
      20% year-over-year and were all-time records. Operating cash flow of $47 billion
      was also an all-time record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue
      categories. iPhone revenue grew 9% year-over-year to an all-time record of $71.6
      billion, despite supply constraints, thanks to a remarkable customer response
      to our new iPhone 13 family. We set all-time records in both developed and emerging
      markets, reached an all-time high in the iPhone active installed base, and the
      latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction
      of 98%. For Mac, revenue of 10.9 billion was an all-time record with growth
      of 25% year over year. driven by strong demand for our newly redesigned MacBook
      Pro powered by M1, despite supply constraints. We are one year into our transition
      to Apple Silicon, and already the vast majority of our Mac sales are from M1
      powered devices. which helped drive a record number of upgraders during the
      December quarter. Our momentum in this category is very impressive as the last
      six quarters have been the best six quarters ever for Mac. iPad generated 7.2
      billion in revenue, down 14% year over year due to very significant supply constraints,
      but customer demand was very strong across all models. Despite the supply shortages,
      our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter,
      thanks to a high number of customers that are new to iPad. In fact, around half
      of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were new to the product.
      Wearables, home, and accessories set a new all-time record of 14.7 billion,
      up 13% year-over-year, and we set all-time revenue records in each geographic
      segment. We also continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this
      category to create unique experiences showcasing our deep integration of hardware,
      software, and services. In addition to an outstanding level of sales performance
      globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of
      customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.
      Turning to services, as I mentioned, we reach an all-time revenue record of
      19.5 billion, up 24%, with all-time records for cloud services, for music, video,
      advertising, and payment services, and a December quarter record for the App
      Store. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we''re seeing
      on many fronts. First, as I mentioned before, our installed base has continued
      to grow and has reached an all-time high across each geographic segment and
      major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement
      with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores
      grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during December quarter in
      every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong
      growth. We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services
      on our platform, which is up to 165 million during the last 12 months alone.
      And finally, we''re adding new services that we think our customers will love,
      and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings.
      Just in this last quarter, we''ve added incredible new content on Apple TV+,
      on Fitness+, and Apple Arcade, and a brand new way to listen to music with Apple
      Music Voice. We also announced in November the beta program for Apple Business
      Essentials, a new service offering that brings together device management, 24-7
      support, and iCloud storage to help small businesses manage the end-to-end lifecycle
      of their employees'' Apple devices. We are very excited that many thousands
      of small business customers are already actively participating in the beta program.
      This announcement is just one of many ways we''re expanding our support for
      enterprise and business customers. With the latest MacBook Pros that we''ve
      introduced last October, the new M1 powered Mac lineup has quickly become the
      preferred choice of Macs among enterprise customers. Shopify, for example, is
      upgrading its entire global workforce to M1 powered MacBook Pro and MacBook
      Air. By standardizing on M1 Macs, Shopify continues its commitment to providing
      the best tools to help its employees work productively and securely from anywhere.
      And Deloitte Consulting is expanding the deployment of the Mac Employee Choice
      program, including offering the new M1 MacBook Pro to empower their professionals
      to choose devices that work best for them in delivering consulting services.
      Let me now turn to our cash position. Due to our strong operating performance
      and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash
      plus marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving
      us with total debt of $123 billion. As a result, net cash was $80 billion at
      the end of the quarter. Our business continues to generate very strong cash
      flow, and we were able to return nearly 27 billion to shareholders during the
      December quarter. This included 3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents, and
      14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. We
      also began 6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting
      in the initial delivery and retirement of 30 million shares. As we move ahead
      into the March quarter, I''d like to review our outlook, which includes the
      types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning
      of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term,
      we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights
      based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not
      worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect
      to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue
      record despite significant supply constraints which we estimate to be less than
      what we experienced during the December quarter. We expect our revenue growth
      rate to decelerate from the December quarter primarily due to two factors. First,
      during the March quarter a year ago, we grew revenue by 54%. Remember that last
      year we launched our new iPhones during the December quarter, while this year
      we launched them during the September quarter. Due to the later launch a year
      ago, some of the associated channel inventory fill occurred during the March
      quarter last year. As a result of the different launch timing, we will face
      a more challenging year-over-year compare. Second, we expect foreign exchange
      to be a three-point headwind when compared to the December quarter growth rate.
      We currently expect FX to have a negative impact on growth of two points in
      the March quarter, while they represented a one-point benefit during the December
      quarter. Specifically related to services, we expect to grow strong double digits
      that decelerate from the December quarter performance. This is due to a more
      challenging compare because a higher level of lockdowns around the world last
      year led to increased usage of digital content and services. We expect gross
      margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OPEX to be between $12.5 billion
      and $12.7 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $150 million, excluding
      any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our
      tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our board of directors has declared
      a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on February 10, 2022,
      to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2022. And with that, let''s open
      the call to questions."}, {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Thank you, Luca. We
      ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first
      question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Absolutely. We''ll take our
      first question from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Caller, please check
      your mute function. We''re unable to hear you. Hearing no response, we''ll take
      our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America."}, {"speaker": "spk08",
      "text": "Yes, thank you. Your margins have clearly been very impressive. So
      I have one question each on product and one on services gross margins. On product
      gross margins, that''s clearly benefiting from a very strong mix. So Tim, I''m
      curious, how sustainable do you think these mixed trends are from the data that
      you see? And can you share any thoughts across how the pro and pro max mix compared
      to prior cycles? And on the services side, if I could just ask that too, When
      you look at the gross margins there, that''s been really impressive. Can you
      give us some sense of where within services you''re seeing particularly favorable
      mixed trends, and how should investors think about their trajectory of these
      margins, given some of the sizable investments you''re making to drive very
      successful areas like content for TV Plus, for example? Thank you."}, {"speaker":
      "spk07", "text": "Wamsi, it''s Tim. In terms of the mix, we don''t comment directly
      on mix, but what I would tell you is that we saw strong demand across the iPhone
      13 family. And in fact, we had several of the top selling models in various
      markets, including the top five in the US and Australia. the top four in urban
      China, two of the top three in the UK, three of the top four in France and Germany,
      and four of the top six in Japan. And certainly based on some external data
      that I''ve seen, it does seem to say that we are gaining share as well. So we
      feel quite good about the momentum of iPhone. And I should add that we were
      constrained during the quarter."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "On the services
      side, you were asking about gross margin there. As you know, our services business
      in aggregate is accretive to overall company margin. And as you know, our services
      portfolio is very broad and it contains businesses with very different margin
      profiles. The difference in margin profile is due in part to the nature of those
      businesses and in part to the way that we account for them. In some cases, we
      account on a net basis as opposed to a gross basis. And so as a result, the
      services gross margin percentage over time will be influenced by by the relative
      growth of the different businesses within the portfolio. You know, we do not
      guide at the product and services level, but I think you''ve seen the guidance
      that we provided for the March quarter at the total company level, 42.5% to
      43.5%, obviously very strong compared to our recent history, and so we''re very
      pleased with that."}, {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Thanks, Jim. Thanks, Luca.
      Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk03",
      "text": "We''ll take our next question from Kyle McNeely with Jefferies."},
      {"speaker": "spk14", "text": "Hi, thanks very much. Congrats on the solid iPhone
      result. That''s very good. I assume that you may have prioritized iPhone to
      the extent there may be similar components that are used for iPhone and iPad.
      Can you just level set me on that if that''s not the case? And if it is, Should
      we see a recovery in iPad as you move past your prime iPhone selling season
      and you may have, you know, better access to components or better supplies as
      we move through the next few months of the year?"}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text":
      "Yeah, Kyle, it''s Tim. From a supply constraint point of view, as you recall,
      we said in Q1, the December quarter, that we would have constraints more than
      six. And we clearly did have constraints more than six. For March, we''re saying
      that we will do better or have less constraints than we had in the December
      quarter. If you look at the commonality between different products, there is
      some, but generally the... The challenge is on legacy nodes and these legacy
      nodes are by supplier. And so it''s much more focused on the supplier than anything
      else and versus us behind the curtain, finding a place to take it. There''s
      not none of that, but there is some of that, but largely we have to take it
      where the shortages are."}, {"speaker": "spk14", "text": "Okay, great. Can you
      give us any other color on kind of the trajectory of iPad and, you know, what''s
      impacting this quarter and where it might go in the March and the June quarter?"},
      {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Yeah, the issue with iPad, and it was a very significant
      constraint in the December quarter, was very much on these legacy nodes that
      I had talked about. Virtually all of the problem was in that area. And so, overall,
      we''re not guiding by product or constraint by product level, but at the, but
      overall, we do see an improvement in the March quarter in terms of the constraints
      going down versus what they were in the December quarter."}, {"speaker": "spk14",
      "text": "Okay, great. Thanks so much. Congrats again on the results all around."},
      {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Oh, thanks very much. Thank you, Kyle. Can we
      have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Thank you.
      We''ll take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research."}, {"speaker":
      "spk05", "text": "Thank you very much. Tim, could you talk a bit about the Mac
      business? Looking back, it''s up about 50% from the calendar 2019 revenue. You
      did almost $11 billion this quarter, and you''re still working through the M1
      transition. So can you talk about where you see the opportunity to gain share?
      What are really sort of the target markets that you think you can go after in
      order to grow this beyond 2020? I think it was about 37 billion in the last
      12 months. Thank you. I''m going to have a follow-up."}, {"speaker": "spk07",
      "text": "Yeah, Shannon, thank you for the question. MAC set an all-time revenue
      record at $10.9 billion for the quarter. That was up 25%. And as you point out,
      the last six quarters for the MAC have been the top six revenue quarters of
      all time. And what''s further very good about this is we set all-time revenue
      records in Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific. And we set a December
      quarter record in greater China. And so it''s not narrowed to a particular geographic
      area that we''re doing well in. It''s almost across the board. The response
      is very much because of M1. And we got even more response with the MacBook Pro
      that we launched during the Q1 time frame. Both the upgraders, which we had
      a record number of upgraders for the December quarter, but also in markets like
      China, six out of ten sales are to people new to the market. And so it''s, you
      know, powered by both upgraders and switchers. Customer satisfaction is off
      the charts. And so what I see this as is a that will a product that will be
      very successful in a number of different markets from education to business
      to the creative industry and in all geographic markets. We''re not limiting
      ourselves."}, {"speaker": "spk05", "text": "Great. Thank you. And then, Luca,
      can you talk a bit more on services? Just, you know, obviously outperformed
      your guidance or your expectations as well as certainly where we were at. You
      know, where were the outperformings? What were the things that really outperformed
      and maybe what trends are you seeing that is driving the extra revenue? Thank
      you."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Yes, Shannon. It was really great on all
      fronts. We set December quarter records in every geographic segment. And then,
      as I mentioned earlier, an all-time record for cloud, for music, for video,
      for advertising, for payment services. December quarter record in the app store.
      So we''ve done, as you said, better than we were expecting at the beginning
      of the quarter. This overperformance has been, you know, spread around the world
      and spread around our services categories. And the reality is, you know, this
      combination of factors, the fact that the install base is growing, the fact
      that We continue to have more and more engagement of our customers on all the
      services. Paid subscriptions is a phenomenal story, right? We now have 785 million
      paid subs. We''ve increased 165 million in the last 12 months alone, right?
      And so all these things combined are really powering the business. Very, very
      pleased with the performance."}, {"speaker": "spk05", "text": "Okay, thank you."},
      {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Thanks."}, {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Can we
      have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "We''ll hear
      next from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley."}, {"speaker": "spk04", "text":
      "Thank you. Can you hear me okay?"}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Now we can.
      Yes."}, {"speaker": "spk04", "text": "Okay, good. So first question, just as
      it relates to some of the disruption you''ve seen on the component side, manufacturing
      and logistics over the past couple of years, are you concerned starting to rethink
      your broader supply chain strategy or the manufacturing footprint on the back
      of the significant disruption? Are you happy with the overall geographic exposure
      that you see in the supply chain today?"}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Katie,
      if you sort of step back and look at how we''ve done this, Our largest issue
      by far has been the chip shortage that is industry wide and on these legacy
      nodes, as I had mentioned earlier. And I think our supply chain actually does
      very good considering the shortages because it''s a fast-moving supply chain.
      The cycle times are very short. There''s very little distance between a chip
      being fabricated and packaged and a product going out of factory. And so, no,
      I don''t see that it... makes a fundamental change in the supply chain."}, {"speaker":
      "spk04", "text": "Okay, thank you. And how are you thinking about the metaverse
      opportunity and Apple''s role in that market?"}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text":
      "Well, that''s a big question, but we''re a company in the business of innovation,
      so we''re always exploring new and emerging technologies. And you''ve spoken
      at length about how this area is very interesting to us. Right now, we have
      over 14,000 ARKit apps in the App Store. which provide incredible AR experiences
      for millions of people today. And so we see a lot of potential in this space
      and are investing accordingly."}, {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Thank you. Congrats
      on the quarter. Thanks so much. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?"},
      {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Thank you. We''ll take our next question from
      Amit Daryani with Evercore."}, {"speaker": "spk09", "text": "Thanks for taking
      my question. I have two as well. I guess close up on the supply chain side,
      I think things continue to be fairly volatile. I''d love to get your perspective.
      Do you feel if things or supply chain issues are starting to alleviate or they
      still remain challenging? And then maybe I missed this, but could you perhaps
      tell us how much revenue was left on the table in December because of these
      supply chain issues? And how did that number shake over March?"}, {"speaker":
      "spk07", "text": "Yeah, Amit, what we''ve said in terms of December and March
      was that, you know, it''s very difficult to estimate with great precision constraints.
      But we said that they would be more than the Q4 or more than the September quarter.
      And we''re saying that March will be less than the December quarter. And so
      that''s the kind of verbiage that we placed around it. In terms of is it still
      challenging? Yes, it is challenging. And for us, we pride ourselves on getting
      products to customers who really want them and try to do that in a fast fashion.
      uh basis and so it''s it''s frustrating that we can''t always do that at the
      speed that that we would like uh however uh march is better than december and
      and so there''s some there''s some encouraging sign there we''re not predicting
      uh overall obviously because of the number of variables that that go into such
      a prediction"}, {"speaker": "spk09", "text": "Fair enough. Tim, I think one
      of the topics investors can struggle a fair bit with Apple is really just trying
      to understand visibility around your product roadmap. And I think some of your
      tech peers tend to be more vocal about their initiative. Some of them go change
      their name when they find an initiative that''s attractive, I feel. You folks
      are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in 2021, so you''re really spending
      a fair amount. And maybe without telling us the roadmap, can you just talk about
      how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on? And to some extent,
      as a way to think about this R&D spend, how much of it is really done on things
      that are more evolutionary and products that are out there in the marketplace
      versus things that we haven''t seen yet around potential new offerings?"}, {"speaker":
      "spk07", "text": "You know, we have a little different model. We try to announce
      things when they''re ready or close to ready and try to maintain an element
      of surprise in there. And so that explains hopefully what we do with our roadmap.
      And I think that''s proven useful. successful for us and other people can do
      it differently, of course, but it''s been good for us over time to do that.
      So we''re going to continue to do that. In terms of deciding where we invest
      in, we look at areas that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software,
      and services. And because we think that that''s where the magic really happens
      and it brings out the best in Apple. And so there are areas that have... more
      than piqued our interest, and we are investing in those. And you can tell through
      time that we''ve ramped our R&D spend even more than we were before. And so
      there''s quite a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market
      at this point, as there always are. Thanks for the question."}, {"speaker":
      "spk02", "text": "Thank you. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?"},
      {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Thank you. We''ll hear next from David Voigt with
      UBS."}, {"speaker": "spk13", "text": "Great. Thanks for taking my call and my
      question. I just wanted to dive in and get your perspective on China and sort
      of the macro climate there and how that sort of pertains to your business as
      we think about it going forward. And the reason why I''m asking is we''ve heard
      some concerns that current policies might have caused a pause in this market
      and smartphone inventory has Maybe more specifically, the local vendors could
      be a little bit elevated going into Chinese New Year. So we''d just love to
      get your thoughts on what you''re seeing in this market around disordered potential
      development, and then maybe touch on sell-in versus sell-through in that market.
      And then I have a follow-up."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Well, I can only
      comment on, for us, our sales grew 21% there in the last quarter, and we''re
      very proud of that. I''ll stay away and let other people be the economist and
      make the macro determinations. But what we''re seeing there was super impressive
      with all-time revenue records and a record number of upgraders and strong double
      digit growth in switchers on iPhone, which is very important to us. And as I
      mentioned before, we had the top four selling phones in urban China. And so
      there''s a lot of good there. And I would remind you that iPhone was constrained
      in the quarter. And so I''m not sure where the statements are coming around
      about inventory. And I can''t comment on whether other people have more or not.
      I don''t know the answer to that."}, {"speaker": "spk13", "text": "Thanks for
      the question. And then maybe just maybe just on the supply chain, you know,
      obviously you''ve been managing it incredibly well the last 12 to 18 months
      and gross margins have actually performed relatively well, you know, mixed driven
      both between product and services. You know, can you help us think about sort
      of the quantifiable impact or maybe the cost that you''re carrying due to the
      supply chain that may be sort of, you know, I don''t want to use the word transitory,
      but, you know, you''d expect over the longer term that might be sort of a, you
      know, sort of a bait a little bit and you''ll get a little bit of a benefit
      as we get past some of these supply chain issues over the next 12 months or
      so."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "We''re seeing inflation and it''s factored
      into our gross margin and OPEX that Luca mentioned. reviewed with you earlier.
      Logistics, as I''ve mentioned on a previous call, is very elevated in terms
      of the cost of moving things around. I would hope that at least a portion of
      that is transitory, but the world has changed, and so we''ll see."}, {"speaker":
      "spk02", "text": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Yep."}, {"speaker":
      "spk02", "text": "Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker":
      "spk03", "text": "Thank you. We''ll take a question from Samik Chatterjee with
      JP Morgan."}, {"speaker": "spk06", "text": "Great. Thanks for taking my question.
      I had a couple. The first question that I had was really on Apple TV+. And I
      know some of the other players in this market have talked about slowing subscriber
      growth as we exit the pandemic. So curious if you can share what trends you''re
      seeing in Apple TV and Apple TV+. And how similar or dissimilar they are and
      how your content is maybe helping you on that aspect and have a follow-up."},
      {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "You know, we don''t give out subscriber numbers
      for Apple TV+. What we do do is give out a subscriber number for our subscription
      number for the total number of subscriptions that we had. And I think Luca mentioned
      earlier, we ended the quarter at 785 million. And so we were incredibly pleased
      with that. That''s a huge growth on a year-over-year basis of 165. And it counts,
      as you recall, both Apple-branded and third-party. In terms of how we''re doing
      with TV+, we''ve been honored with 200 wins and 890 nominations. uh we''re doing
      exactly like uh we had wanted to with giving storytellers a place to tell original
      stories and uh feel really good about uh where we are competitively and strategic
      position of the product and if i can just follow up uh and similarly on apple
      b um can you"}, {"speaker": "spk06", "text": "just help us think about when
      you think about the next few years, where are the biggest opportunities, either
      be it in terms of geographies or customer segments that you may not be tapping
      into currently and have an opportunity in. Thank you."}, {"speaker": "spk07",
      "text": "Well, putting aside any kind of thing that''s on our roadmap for a
      second in that area, which we obviously wouldn''t talk about in the call, I
      would say that I think Apple Card has a great runway ahead of us. It was rated
      to the number one midsize credit card and customer set by J.D. Power and is
      getting as fast become people''s main credit card for many, many people. And
      the growth of Apple Pay has just been stunning. It''s been absolutely stunning.
      And there''s still obviously a lot more there to go. And And because there''s
      still a lot of cash in the environment. And so I think that both of these and
      whatever else we might do have a great future ahead."}, {"speaker": "spk02",
      "text": "Congrats on the results."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Thanks so
      much."}, {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Thanks. Can we have the next question,
      please?"}, {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Thank you. We''ll take our next question
      from Chris Caso with Raymond James."}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Yes, thank
      you. Good evening. The first question is just a little bit of help in interpreting
      the guidance. And if you could speak to the March quarter, perhaps in terms
      of seasonality and seasonal performance. And Luca, as you mentioned last year,
      because of the late launch, later launch of the phone, that some of that came
      into the March quarter and that was better than seasonal performance in March.
      Should we interpret because The supply constraints are easing somewhat as you
      go into the March quarter that we should see something similar that, you know,
      March quarter we''d get some better than seasonal performance. Is that the correct
      way to interpret your guidance?"}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "We talked about
      it on a year-over-year basis because that''s probably how most people look at
      it. And so just to recap what we said, first of all, we expect a record for
      the March quarter. We expect solid growth on a year-over-year basis. But as
      Tim was saying, we still expect significant supply constraints, but less than
      what we''ve seen in December. So I think on that basis, you can do the math
      around sequential. But given where we are in the environment, given the difficult
      compare, both on iPhone and as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, on services,
      we''re very, very happy with the way we''re guiding and the way the business
      is going right now."}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Thank you. As a follow-up,
      a follow-up question is on perhaps the sustainability and repeatability of the
      growth in iPhone after two very good years, well-received product and the 5G
      upgrade cycle. And I think there was a point in time when perhaps it was a view
      from some that iPhone was X growth, and that''s been proven wrong. Off of these
      very strong results, maybe you could speak to your level of confidence that
      iPhone continues to grow in the future and kind of what are the avenues for
      that growth?"}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Yeah, Chris, it''s Tim. What I
      would say is that the iPhone has become an integral part of so many people''s
      lives now more than ever. And the active install base of iPhone continues to
      grow and is now at an all-time high. And during December, as we had mentioned,
      we had a record number of upgraders and grew switchers strong double digit,
      which I think speaks to the strength of the product. And that''s all in addition
      to an enormous customer satisfaction rating of 98% and are doing well throughout
      the geographies. And I''ve mentioned some of the geos that we track and how
      many units that we have on the top-selling model charts. And even though this
      is the second... second product announcement that has 5G in it, we''re still
      really in the early innings of 5G. I mean, if you look at the install base and
      look at how many people are on 5G versus not, and we don''t release those exact
      numbers, but you can do some math and estimate those. We maintain a very optimistic
      view on iPhone long-term."}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Thank you very much."},
      {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Yes, thank you. Thanks. Can we have the next question,
      please?"}, {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Thank you. I''ll take the next question
      from Ben Bolin with Cleveland Research."}, {"speaker": "spk11", "text": "Thank
      you for taking the question. Tim, I''m interested in how you think about the
      relationship between the total IOS installed base and then the subsequent performance
      you see within the services or the paid subscriptions. And a second part to
      that is how do you look at the existing services business in terms of the growth
      you get from customers who are already subscribers versus completely net new
      or greenfield subscribers?"}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "I think I''ll let
      Luca comment on the second part of that. But if you back up and sort of look
      at how we''re doing, even though we have 785 million subs, relative to the total
      number of products offered and the customers it''s offered in, there''s still
      a lot of room to grow there. And so the way that I look at it is that there''s
      a lot more greenfield in front of us."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "And Ben,
      on the services engagement and how we think about customers, right? Obviously,
      it''s important for us that customers are engaged on our services platforms.
      and you know the ones that we have we know that the more engaged they are they''re
      more likely to stay with apple for the long term so we just obviously track
      all those metrics and they''re very important for us and and that''s why we
      continue to improve the quality of our offerings and the quantity over time
      as you''ve seen we''ve launched a lot of new services we obviously care a lot
      about new customers as well. That''s why we keep track of the install base and
      a lot of other metrics on that front. It''s very similar to what we do with
      products. I mean, also for products, we care a lot about upgraders. We care
      a lot about switchers. It''s obviously the combination of the two that when
      you put it together, provides the level of growth that you''ve actually seen
      in our services business. I mean, the last 12 months we''ve done over $72 billion
      of revenue on services. It''s the size of a Fortune 50 company. It couldn''t
      happen without contribution from both existing and new customers."}, {"speaker":
      "spk02", "text": "Thank you. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?"},
      {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Thank you. We''ll take our next question from
      Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler."}, {"speaker": "spk10", "text": "Yeah. Hey,
      guys. First of all, congratulations on stellar quarter in December and all the
      records that the Apple community has set. Tim, I had a question on the content
      on Apple TV. When we look at the Apple content that you guys put out on TV,
      original content, it''s typically very socially responsible and healthy, for
      example, at Ted Lasso. Has this, in effect, created a constraint or a hesitancy
      of some sort for Apple to go and purchase studios when they come up? Or have
      those decisions been primarily financial or otherwise?"}, {"speaker": "spk07",
      "text": "We don''t make purely financial decisions about the content. We try
      to find great content that has a reason for being. And we love shows like Ted
      Lasso and several of the other shows as well that have a reason for existing
      and may have a good message and may make people feel better at the end of it.
      But I don''t view that we''ve narrowed our universe of things we''re selecting
      from. There''s plenty to pick from out there. And I think that we''re doing
      a pretty good job of it as we speak."}, {"speaker": "spk10", "text": "Fair enough.
      And then my follow-up was the Apple vision of healthcare in the future. You
      guys have sort of cautiously approached healthcare with iWatch and iPhone. It''s
      mostly a preventative sort of approach. It provides you updates. But do you
      see a situation down the line where Apple perhaps plays a more active role,
      either through the watch or some other device where perhaps a doctor or a hospital
      mandates that the watch be worn effectively for critical and vital monitoring?
      And I was curious if you could just give us some color on how you guys think
      about healthcare and iWatch and that confluence."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text":
      "Well, with the Apple Watch, there''s literally not days that go by without
      me getting notes about someone that''s received a health alert. Maybe it''s
      to do with their cardiovascular health or more recently, a lot of people have
      told me that they fell and was knocked unconscious and couldn''t respond. And
      the watch responded for them to emergency contacts and emergency personnel.
      And so there''s a lot that we''re doing today. My sense has always been that
      there''s more here. I don''t want to get into a roadmap discussion in the call,
      but we continue to kind of pull the string and see where it takes us. But we''re
      really satisfied with how we''re doing in this area because we are fundamentally
      changing people''s lives and in some cases saving people''s lives. So it''s
      an area of great interest."}, {"speaker": "spk02", "text": "Very helpful, Tim.
