      "text": "Good day and welcome to the Apple Q1 Fiscal Year 2021 earnings conference
      call. Today''s call is being recorded. At this time for opening remarks and
      introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Ghatla, Director
      of Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good
      afternoon and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim
      Cook, and he''ll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we''ll open the
      call to questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you''ll
      hear during our discussion today will consist of forward-looking statements
      including, without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating
      expenses, other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business
      outlook, including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company''s business
      and results of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties
      that may cause actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast.
      For more information, please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple''s
      most recently filed annual report on Form 10K and the Form 8K filed with the
      SEC today, along with the associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation
      to update any forward-looking statements or information which speak as of their
      respective dates. I''d now like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory
      remarks. Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone. Thanks for joining the
      call today. It''s with great gratitude for the tireless and innovative work
      of every Apple team member worldwide that I share If you''re using useless retail
      trading charts like this, please quit trading immediately. Just stop unless
      you enjoy throwing money down the drain, of course. Now, this is what real financial
      institutions look at when trading professionally. They can see real buyers and
      sellers inside the candlesticks. Can you see the difference? The two are not
      even comparable. This is just gambling. This is proper trading. I should know,
      I spent years trading for one of the biggest banks in the world, Barclays investment
      bank, and we weren''t using junk like technical analysis and random lines on
      our chart, like I see spoken about on this channel. So you can see why you have
      no hope of making it in trading if that''s the type of stuff you''re looking
      at. Easy solution. Stop sabotaging yourself with random retail lines on a chart
      that a child could draw and start looking at the right stuff, the stuff institutions
      are looking at. So how can you do that? Easy. Now my name is Nirav and in just
      one single free video I''m going to show you how my colleagues and I working
      at one of the biggest banks in the world ran rings around retail traders like
      yourself simply because we had access to the right information and we knew retail
      traders like yourself were wasting their time using the same stuff as kids on
      social media and YouTube who don''t actually have a clue how this works in a
      professional firm. firms that do this every day, making millions. Now you can
      continue doing what you''re doing, but as I think you already know, there''s
      much more to this business than a bunch of random lines on a candlestick chart.
      And in just one video, I''m going to show you exactly what you should be doing.
      And it''s just going to blow you away and completely turn your trading on its
      head, not to mention your results. How can I say that so confidently? because
      I''m the only 100% fully audited institutional trader on the internet and in
      the free masterclass you''re about to watch you''ll even get access to all my
      fully audited results something no retail educator ever shows because they don''t
      actually make any money they''re just very good at showing off a lifestyle paid
      for by you Let''s change that today. So what are you waiting for? Click the
      link below. It''s a free video. So you have nothing to lose, but an incredible
      amount to gain. And by the end of it, you will know exactly what professional
      traders like myself are doing in the biggest trading institutions in the world.
      And you''ll see it''s the complete opposite of anything being done on social
      media or YouTube. Click the link below. I''ll personally see you on the other
      side. the results of a very strong quarter for Apple. We achieved an all-time
      revenue record of $111.4 billion. We saw strong double-digit growth across every
      product category, and we achieved all-time revenue records in each of our geographic
      segments. It is not far from any of our minds that this result caps off the
      most challenging year any of us can remember. And it is an understatement to
      say that the challenges it posed to Apple as a business paled in comparison
      to the challenge it posed to Apple as a community of individuals, to employees,
      to their families, and to the communities we live in and love to call home.
      While these results show the central role that our products played in helping
      our users respond to these challenges, we are doubly aware that the work ahead
      of all of us to navigate the end of this pandemic, to restore normal life and
      prosperity in our neighborhoods and local economies, and to build back with
      a sense of justice is profound and urgent. We will speak to these needs and
      Apple''s efforts throughout today''s call, but I want to first offer the context
      of a detailed look at our results this quarter, including why we outperformed
      our expectations. Let''s get started with hardware. We hit a new high water
      mark for our installed base of active devices with growth accelerating as we
      passed 1.65 billion devices worldwide during the December quarter. iPhone grew
      by 17% year over year, driven by strong demand for the iPhone 12 family and
      our active install base of iPhones is now over 1 billion. The customer response
      to the new iPhone 12 models unprecedented innovation from world-class cameras
      to the great and growing potential of 5G has been enthusiastic, even in light
      of the ongoing COVID-19 impact at retail locations. iPad and Mac grew by 41
      and 21 percent respectively, reflecting the continuing role these devices have
      played in our users'' lives during the COVID-19 pandemic. During this quarter,
      availability began for both our new iPad Air as well as the first generation
      of Macs to feature our groundbreaking M1 chip. The demand for all of these products
      has been very strong. We have also continued our efforts to bring the latest
      iPads, enriching content, and professional support to educators, students, and
      parents. Educational districts and governments worldwide are continuing major
      deployments, including the largest iPad deployments ever to schools in Germany
      and Japan. Wearables, home, and accessories grew by 30% year-over-year, driven
      by significant holiday demand for the latest Apple Watch, our entire AirPods
      lineup, including the new AirPods Max, as well as the new HomePod Mini. This
      broad strength across the category led to new revenue records for each of its
      three subgroups. And we''re very excited about the road ahead for these products.
      So what makes this special? I mean, there are wind turbines out there. There
      are vertical axis wind turbines out there. What is special about this one? So
      we''ve got the ability, unlike anyone else out there right now, because of our
      patented technology, to reduce our size in high winds. So it lets us reduce
      our exposure to the wind and keep right on producing full power through storms
      that you normally have to be shut, that other turbines have to be shut down
      for, or it destroys them. Wow. Yeah. Well, what about the noise? Often when
      you drive out into the country and there''s those big wind farms, when you...
      What are you doing? Listening. There''s no noise. Even in 20, 25, 30 mile an
      hour winds, every test we''ve done so far, no noise. Right. Wow. It''s because
      our whole geometry, everything about our design is different than wind turbines
      out there. And that''s all I''m going to say about it. We''re very different
      in the way we capture wind. So this is sort of like You just started from scratch
      and made this work of art. It''s very pretty to look at, and I''m not an artist,
      but if you get artsy people around this, can you imagine what all they would
      do with it, like painting all these things around it that look awesome? Nobody
      that talks to us ever says, oh, that''s ugly, I wouldn''t want that. Everyone
      says, that''s beautiful, or that''s so cool, that''s so awesome when they look
      at it. And it is. It''s beautiful. It''s because we built Harmony from the ground
      up. Nobody has small scale wind turbines because they''re terrible. Pretty much.
      Pretty much from what we''ve seen, the only people that use small-scale wind
      turbines on a regular basis are people in the boating community. But they''re
      even calling us saying, this doesn''t work. This is not the right application.
      They break. They''re noisy. These big propeller-type wind turbines that are
      scaled down to something that they''re using on the boats just isn''t right
      for that application. So this is exciting because this introduces something
      completely new that meets all those needs. Yeah, I mean, shrinking down the
      big boy technology that nobody wants near their home or their neighborhood anyway
      because it''s ugly, it''s noisy, it''s dangerous. Why would they think that
      shrinking that down and selling it to the public is going to be a good idea,
      you know? It just, it''s not. Well, it''s what was available. You have to start
      from the ground up and build something the right way. Beautiful, quiet, easy
      to look at, and functions well. It starts in low wind. It functions in high
      wind. I mean, we''ve got everything that people want, all the check boxes that
      they want when they''re looking for a product. Guess what? We built that into
      Harmony. Take care, guys. Harmony Turbines. We now have the power to change
      the world. This winter, make the shortest days the fullest. Get 3.79% APR for
      60 months on most 2023 Cadillac models. Look no further than the great potential
      of Fitness Plus, which pairs with Apple Watch to deliver real-time on-screen
      fitness data alongside world-class workouts by the world''s best trainers. There
      are new sessions added each week and customers are loving the flexibility, challenge,
      and fun of these classes, as well as how the pairing with Apple Watch pushes
      you to achieve your fitness goals. The steep integration of hardware, software,
      and services have always defined our approach here and it has delivered an all-time
      quarterly services record of $15.8 billion. This was the first quarter of the
      Apple One bundle, which brings together many of our great services into an easy
      subscription. And with new content being added to these services every day,
      we feel very optimistic about where we are headed. The App Store ecosystem has
      been so important as individuals, families, and businesses worldwide evolve
      and adapt to the COVID-19 pandemic. And we want to make sure that this unrivaled
      engine of innovation and opportunity continues. This quarter, we also took a
      significant new step to help smaller developers continue to experiment, innovate,
      and scale the latest great app ideas. The App Store small business program reduces
      the commission on the sale of digital goods and services to 15 percent for small
      businesses earning less than one million dollars a year. The program launched
      on January 1st, and we are already hearing from developers about how this change
      represents a transformation in their potential to create and grow on the App
      Store. Tomorrow is International Privacy Day, and we continue to set new standards
      to protect users'' right to privacy, not just for our own products, but to be
      the ripple in the pond that moves the whole industry forward. Most recently,
      we''re in the process of deploying new requirements across the App Store ecosystem
      that give users more knowledge about and new tools to control the ways that
      apps gather and share their personal data. The winter holiday season is always
      a busy time for us and our products. But this year was unique. We had a record
      number of device activations during the last week of the quarter. And as COVID-19
      kept us apart, we saw the highest volume of FaceTime calls ever this Christmas.
      As always, we could not have made so many holidays special without our talented
      and dedicated retail teams who helped us achieve a new all-time revenue record
      for retail driven by very strong performance in our online store. Particularly
      after the events of the last few weeks, we''re focused on how we can help a
      moment of great national need. Because none of us should have any illusions
      about the challenges we face as we begin a new chapter in the American story.
      Hope for healing, for unity, and for progress begins with and depends on addressing
      the things that continue to wound us. In our communities, we see how every burden
      from COVID-19 to the resulting economic challenges, to the closure of in-person
      learning for students falls heaviest on those who have always faced structural
      barriers to opportunity and equality. This month, Apple announced major new
      commitments through a $100 million racial equity and justice initiative. The
      Propel Center launched with a $25 million commitment and with the support of
      historically black colleges and universities across the country will help support
      the next generation of leaders in fields ranging from machine learning to app
      development to entrepreneurship and design. And our new Apple Developer Academy
      in downtown Detroit will be the first of its kind in the United States. Detroit
      has a vibrant culture of black entrepreneurship, including over 50,000 black
      owned businesses. We want to accelerate the potential of the app economy here,
      knowing there is no shortage of good ideas in such a creative, resilient and
      dedicated community. Finally, We''re committing $35 million across two investments
      in Harlem Capital and the Clear Vision Impact Fund that support, accelerate,
      and grow minority-owned businesses in areas of great potential and need. In
      December, we concluded an unmatched year of giving. Since the inception of the
      Apple Giving Program in 2011, Apple employees have donated nearly $600 million
      and volunteered more than 1.6 million hours to over 34,000 organizations of
      every stride. If we do have a multi-million barrel a day Russian disruption
      because of the sanctions or additional Russian supply disruption, the real question
      will be, now that OPEC has pulled barrels back, will OPEC deploy those barrels
      if there''s a shortfall come December? And also, because of these sanctions,
      you''re actually going to need more Middle Eastern barrels to move to Europe
      to backfill the Russian losses. Through our partnership with Product Red, we''ve
      adapted our 14-year, $250 million effort to support HIV and AIDS work globally
      to ensure that care continues even in the time of COVID. That includes delivering
      millions of units of personal protective equipment to healthcare providers in
      Zambia. And here in the United States, even with COVID''s effects, we are ahead
      of schedule on our multi-year commitment to invest $350 billion throughout the
      American economy. As proud as this makes us, we know there is much more to be
      done. Looking forward, we continue to contend with the COVID-19 pandemic, but
      we must also now work to imagine what we will inherit on the other side. When
      a disease recedes, we cannot simply assume that healing follows. Even now, we
      see the deep scars that this period has left on our communities. Trust has been
      compromised, opportunities have been lost, entire portions of our lives that
      we took for granted, schools for our children, meetings with our colleagues,
      small businesses that have endured for generations, have simply disappeared.
      It will take a society-wide effort across the public and private sectors as
      individuals and communities, every one of us, to ensure that what''s ahead of
      us is not simply the end of a disease, but the beginning of something durable
      and hopeful for those who gave, suffered, and endured during this time. At Apple,
      we have every intention to be partners in this effort, and we look forward to
      working in communities around the world to make it possible. And as this chapter
      of uncertainty continues, so will our tireless work to help our customers stay
      safe, connected, and well. With that, I''ll hand things over to Luca. Thank
      you, Tim. Good afternoon, everyone. We started our fiscal 2021 with exceptional
      business and financial performance during the December quarter. As we said,
      all-time records for revenue, operating income, net income, earnings per share,
      and operating cash flow. We are thrilled with the way our teams continue to
      innovate and execute throughout this period of elevated uncertainty. Our revenue
      reached an all-time record of $111.4 billion, an increase of nearly $20 billion,
      or 21% from a year ago. We grew strong double digits in each of our product
      categories with all-time records for iPhone, wearables home and accessories
      and services, as well as a December quarter record for Mac. We also achieved
      double digit growth and new all-time records in each of our five geographic
      segments and in the vast majority of countries that we track. Products revenue
      was an all-time record of 95.7 billion, up 21% over a year ago. As a consequence
      of this level of sales performance and the unmatched loyalty of our customers,
      our installed base of active devices passed 1.65 billion during the December
      quarter and reached an all-time record in each of our major product categories.
      Our services set an all-time record of $15.8 billion, growing 24% year over
      year. We established new all-time records in most service categories and December
      quarter records in each geographic segment. I''ll cover our services business
      in more detail later. Company gross margin was 39.8%, up 160 basis points sequentially,
      thanks to leverage from higher sales and a strong mix. Products gross margin
      was 35.1%, growing 530 basis points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix.
      Services gross margin was 68.4%, up 150 basis points sequentially, mainly due
      to a different mix. Net income, diluted earnings per share, and operating cash
      flow were all-time records. Net income was 28.8 billion, up 6.5 billion or 29%
      over last year. Diluted earnings per share were $1.68, up 35% over last year.
      And operating cash flow was 38.8 billion, an improvement of 8.2 billion. Let
      me get into more detail for each of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was
      a record 65.6 billion, growing 17% year over year, as demand for the iPhone
      12 family was very strong despite COVID-19 and social distancing measures, which
      have impacted store operations in a significant manner. Our active install base
      of iPhones reached a new all-time high and has now surpassed one billion devices,
      thanks to the exceptional loyalty of our customer base and strength of our ecosystem.
      In fact, in the U.S., the latest survey of consumers from 451 Research indicates
      iPhone customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 12 family. Turning to services,
      as I said, we reached an all-time revenue record of $15.8 billion and set all-time
      records in App Store, cloud services, music, advertising, Apple Care, and payment
      services. Our new service offerings, Apple TV+, Apple Arcade, Apple News+, Apple
      Card, Apple Fitness+, as well as the Apple One bundle, are also contributing
      to overall services growth and continue to add users, content, and features.
      The key drivers for our services growth all continue to move in the right direction.
      First, our install-based growth has accelerated and is an all-time high across
      each major product category. Second, the number of both transacting and paid
      accounts on our digital content stores reach a new all-time high during the
      December quarter with paid accounts increasing double digits in each of our
      geographic segments. What should the future deliver? Progress? Innovation? Discovery?
      Or simply, stability? Security? Protection? You shouldn''t have to choose. Gold.
      Your strategic advantage. Visit GoldHub.com Paid subscriptions continue to grow
      nicely, and we exceeded our target of 600 million paid subscriptions before
      the end of calendar 2020. During the December quarter, we added more than 35
      million sequentially, and we now have more than 620 million paid subscriptions
      across the services on our platform, up 140 million from just a year ago. Finally,
      we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current services offerings
      and are adding new services that we think our customers will love. For example,
      Apple Music recently released its biggest product update ever, with features
      like Listen Now, All New Search, Personal Radio Stations, and AutoPlay. Ninety
      percent of Apple Music users on iOS 14 have already used these new features.
      In payment services, we continue to expand our coverage, with nearly 90 percent
      of stores in the United States now accepting Apple Pay. so that customers can
      easily have a touchless payments experience. Wearables, home, and accessories
      grew 30% year over year to $13 billion, setting new all-time revenue records
      in every geographic segment. As a result of this strong performance, our wearables
      business is now the size of a Fortune 120 company. Importantly, Apple Watch
      continues to extend its reach with nearly 75% of the customers purchasing Apple
      Watch during the quarter being new to the product. We''re very excited about
      the future of this category and believe that our integration of hardware, software,
      and services uniquely positions us to provide great customer experience in this
      category. Next, I''d like to talk about Mac. We set a December quarter record
      for revenue at 8.7 billion, up 21% over last year. We grew strong double digits
      in each geographic segment and set all-time revenue records in Europe and rest
      of Asia-Pacific, as well as December quarter records in the Americas, greater
      China, and in Japan. This performance was driven by strong demand for the new
      MacBook Air, MacBook Pro, and Mac Mini, all powered by our brand new M1 chip.
      iPad performance was also very impressive with revenue of 8.4 billion, up 41%.
      We grew very strong double digits in every geographic segment, including an
      all-time record in Japan. During the quarter, the all-new iPad Air became available
      and customer response has been terrific. Both Mac and iPad are incredibly relevant
      products for our customers in the current working and learning environments.
      And we are delighted that the most recent surveys of consumers From 451 research,
      measured customer satisfaction of 93% for Mac and 94% for iPad. With this level
      of customer satisfaction and with around half of the customers purchasing Mac
      and iPad during the quarter being new to that product, the active install base
      for both products continues to grow nicely and reach new all-time highs. In
      the enterprise market, we are seeing many businesses shifting their technology
      investment in response to COVID. One example is how businesses are handling
      the hundreds of millions of office desk phones while more employees are working
      remotely. Last quarter, Mitsubishi UFG Bank, one of the largest banks in the
      world, announced that it will be replacing 75% of its fixed phones with iPhones.
      By doing so, it expects to realize significant cost savings while providing
      a secure mobile platform to employees. We''re also pleased with the rapid adoption
      of the Mac employee choice program among the world''s leading businesses who
      are seeing improved productivity, increased employee satisfaction and talent
      retention. With the introduction of M1 powered Macs, we''re excited to extend
      these experiences to an even broader range of customers and employees, especially
      in times of increased remote working. Let me now turn to our cash position.
      We ended the quarter with almost 196 billion in cash plus marketable securities
      and retired 1 billion of maturing debt, leaving us with total debt of 112 billion.
      As a result, net cash was 84 billion at the end of the quarter. We returned
      over 30 billion to shareholders during the December quarter, including 3.6 billion
      in dividends and equivalents and 24 billion. through open market repurchases
      of 200 million Apple shares as we continue on our path to reaching a net cash
      neutral position over time. As we move ahead into the March quarter, I''d like
      to provide some color on what we are seeing, which includes the types of forward-looking
      information that Tejas referred to at the beginning of the call. Given the continued
      uncertainty around the world in the near term, we will not be guiding to a specific
      revenue range. However, we are providing some directional insights, assuming
      the COVID-related impacts of our business do not worsen from our current assumptions
      for the quarter. Dad, I gotta get in there. Okay, thank you. Sorry. Yeah, no
      problem, thank you. It''s all right now. For total company revenue we believe
      growth will accelerate on a year-over-year basis and in aggregate follow typical
      seasonality on a sequential basis. At the product category level, keep in mind
      two items. First, during the March quarter last year, we saw elevated activity
      in our digital services as lockdowns occurred around the world. So our services
      business faces a tougher year-over-year comparison. Second, we believe the year-over-year
      growth in the wearables, home, and accessories category will decelerate compared
      to Q1. As you know, we were chasing demand on AirPods last year as we expand
      the channel inventory from Q1 to Q2. This year, we plan to decrease AirPods
      channel inventory as is typical after the holiday quarter. We expect gross margin
      to be similar to the December quarter. We expect OPEX to be between 10.7 and
      10.9 billion, We expect INE to be around 50 million and our tax rate to be around
      17%. Finally, today our board of directors has declared a cash dividend of 20.5
      cents per share of common stock payable on February 11, 2021 to shareholders
      of record as of February 8, 2021. With that, let''s open the call to questions.
      Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator,
      may we have the first question, please? Certainly. We''ll go ahead and take
      our first question from Katie Huberty with Morgan Family. Please go ahead. Thank
      you. Congratulations on a really strong quarter. First question for Luca. The
      gross margin was particularly strong versus your outlook. Can you talk about
      whether you recognize the full impact of the weaker dollar In the December quarter,
      given your typical currency hedges, and then how are you thinking about the
      headwinds and tailwinds on gross margins as you go into the March quarter? Then
      I have a follow-up for Tim. Yes, Katie. So yes, the gross margin was strong,
      was better than we had anticipated at the beginning of the quarter. The reason
      for that was obviously we had very strong leverage from higher sales and the
      mix was strong, both the mix within products and the mix of services. And that
      was only partially offset by cost. As you know, we launched many new products
      during the fall, and that always comes with new cost structures. So in total,
      it was very good. From the FX standpoint, really at the gross margin level,
      FX didn''t play a role, neither sequentially nor on a year-over-year basis for
      the December quarter. partially because of the hedges that you talked about,
      but also because some currencies are still weaker against the dollar. They''re
      still weaker than a year ago. Look specifically to emerging markets in Latin
      America and Russia and Turkey and so on. Clearly, if the dollar remains weak
      or continues to weaken, that can become a tailwind for us as we get into into
      the March quarter. At current rates, we expect some level of benefit around
      60 to 70 basis points for the March quarter. That''s great. Thank you. And Tim,
      one of the challenges with valuing Apple is just the limited visibility that
      investors have into the roadmap and any new categories that you might enter
      over time. Without, of course, commenting on any given opportunity, can you
      talk about the framework that you use internally to evaluate new markets that
      might be attractive and what you believe will determine your success as you
      look to enter new markets? Thanks, Katie, for the question. And thanks for not
      asking me any specifics. The framework that we use is very much around we ask
      ourselves if this is a product that we would want to use ourselves or a service
      that we would want to use ourselves. And that''s a pretty high bar. And we ask
      ourselves if it''s a big enough market to be in unless it''s an adjacency product
      of which we''re looking at it very much from a customer experience point of
      view. And so there''s no Set way that we''re looking at it, you know, that no
      formula kind of thing, but we''re taking into account all of those things and
      the kind of things that we love to work on. are those where there''s a requirement
      for hardware, software, and services to come together because we believe that
      the magic really occurs at that intersection. And so hopefully that gives you
      a little bit of insight into how we look at it. And I think we have some really
      good opportunities out there. And I think if you look at our current portfolio
      of products, You know, we still have relatively low share in a number of cases
      in very big markets. And so, we feel like we have really good upside there,
      and we feel like we have really good upside in the services area, too, that
      we''ve been working on for quite some time with, you know, four or five new
      services just coming online in the last year, year plus. And so... Yeah, thank
      you. That''s very helpful. Thank you. Thanks, Katie. Can we have the next question,
      please? We''ll hear next from Juan Simo Han with Bank of America. Please go
      ahead. Yes, thank you. Luca, the iPhone growth exceeded your expectations despite
      a late launch. Can you maybe share some color on what drove that? Was it more
      on the unit side or the ASB side you referred to, to very strong mix? a couple
      of times on the call. And how does this change your view on the March quarter?
      And if you could share any color, if you''re still supply constrained, then
      I will follow up with him. Yeah, yes, certainly iPhone was one of the major
      factors why we exceeded our own internal expectations at the beginning of the
      quarter. We have a fantastic product lineup and we know that and it''s been
      fantastic to see the customer response for the four new models, particularly
      the pro models, the pro and the pro max. So we''ve done very, very well both
      on units and on pricing. because of the strong mix. And we''ve had some level
      of supply constraints as we went through the quarter, particularly on the Pro
      and the Pro Max. As you said correctly, we launched these products in the middle
      of the quarter, two models after four weeks, the other two models after seven
      weeks. And so obviously we had a very steep ramp, which fortunately went very,
      very well. The products are doing very well all around the world. I think you''ve
      seen that our performance has been particularly strong in China, where we''ve
      seen phenomenal customer response. Probably there was also some level of pent-up
      demand for 5G iPhones, given that the market is moving very quickly to 5G. And
      so as we look ahead into the March quarter, we''re very optimistic. We believe
      we''re going to be able to be in supply demand balance for all the models at
      some point during the quarter. And it''s, you know, the product is doing very
      well all around the world. Great, thank you, Luca. And Tim, you mentioned about
      the strength of the install-based performance, which continues to grow very
      impressively at this scale. Can you maybe help us think through how the switcher
      versus upgrade activity has been tracking in recent quarters? Would love to
      get your thoughts on that. Thank you. Yeah, thanks for the question. If you
      look at this past quarter, which, you know, has, we started selling two of the
      iPhones four weeks into the quarter and the other two seven weeks into the quarter.
      So I would caution that this is an early going. But in looking at the iPhone
      12 family, we saw both switchers and upgraders increase on a year-over-year
      basis. And in fact, we saw the largest number of upgraders that we''ve ever
      seen in a quarter. And so we were very thrilled about that. What should the
      future deliver? Progress, innovation, or stability, protection? You shouldn''t
      have to choose. Gold, your strategic advantage. Visit GoldHub.com. Thanks, Wamsi.
      Thank you very much. Can we have the next question, please? Yes, we''ll go ahead
      and take our next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Thank you
      very much. Tim, can you talk a bit about what you''re seeing in China, clearly
      significant sequential growth, which I think has a lot to do with iPhone. But
      I''m curious both from an iPhone as well as your other product categories, what
      you''re seeing and how much back to normal you think the Chinese market is.
      And then I have a follow up. Thank you. Yeah, China was more than an iPhone
      story. iPhone did do very well there and sort of like the world. If you look
      at both switches and upgraders, we were up. year over year, and China also had
      a record number of upgraders during the quarter, the most we''ve ever seen in
      a quarter. I think probably some portion of this was that people probably delayed
      purchasing in the previous quarter as rumors started appearing about an iPhone
      Keep in mind that 5G in China is the network is well established. And the overwhelming
      majority of phones being sold are 5G phones. And so I think there was some level
      of anticipation for us delivering an iPhone with 5G. And so iPhone did extremely
      well. However, the other products did as well. I mean, we could not have turned
      in a performance like we did with only iPhone. iPad did extremely well, far
      beyond the company average. Mac was above the company average. Wearables, home
      accessories was above the company average. And so if you really look at it,
      we did really well across the board there. In terms of COVID, I think there,
      at least for last quarter, they were sort of beyond COVID and very much in the
      recovery stage. This quarter, there are different reports about some cases in
      some places and lockdowns occurring, but we have not seen that in our businesses
      yet. Of course, those cases are much smaller than the ones in other countries.
      Right. I guess the other thing I was curious about, with regard to the services
      business, you know, if we could dig a little bit more, I think this is one of
      the first times when, Luca, you talked about Apple TV Plus, Arcade, Apple Pay,
      some of the smaller services actually kind of moving the needle. And then I
      was also curious, you had a number of stores closed At least later in the quarter,
      and that typically has impacted some of your Apple care revenue and yet you
      outperform. So, maybe if you could talk about a bit more about the drivers of
      the services revenue. Thank you. Yeah, I mean, it really has been strong across
      the board. There are 2 businesses during that. have been impacted negatively.
      And then we talked about it in the past. So one is Apple care. Obviously, when
      the stores are closed, it''s tougher, of course, for customers to have the interaction
      with us and advertising, which is, you know, it''s in line with the overall
      level of economic activity. What happened during the December quarter is that
      in-store traffic improved and so AppleCare, we grew. We didn''t grow as much
      as company average, but we grew in AppleCare. set an all-time record there,
      in spite of the fact that, yes, we are running, particularly in December, we
      started closing a few stores, particularly here in the United States, but also
      in Western Europe. But in total, we were able to support more customers than
      in past quarters. And we also saw a sequential acceleration in advertising,
      and so that also helped. the overall growth rate. Clearly, the strength was
      in digital services, in the app store, in cloud services, in music. Those were
      the services that really delivered very, very strong performance. And it''s
      something that we''ve seen happen during the COVID environment. Great. Thank
      you. Thanks, Shannon. Can we have the next question, please? We''ll hear from
      Tony Secondaggi with Bernstein. Yes, thank you. I also have one for Luca and
      one for Tim. Luca, I was wondering if we could just probe a little bit more
      into iPhone. Maybe you can just, you talked about a drawdown in channel inventory
      last quarter. Our iPhone channel inventory is sort of at normal levels now exiting
      Q1. And should we be thinking about above seasonal iPhone growth, given that
      you''re still not in supply demand balance and you had fewer selling days in
      fiscal Q1? Should we be thinking about sort of above seasonal iPhone growth
      looking into Q2? Sales teams have it tough. The pressure to hit their numbers
      keeps rising. The last thing they need to worry about is getting bogged down
      with busy work. Pandadoc is here to make things easy. Create eye-catching documents,
      approve and share them in minutes, get real-time reporting, all while you simply
      connect our software with the tools you love. Workflows are streamlined, contracts
      are signed, everyone''s good. Automate proposals and speed up your deals with
      Pandadoc. So on the on the December performance as you know Tony this was a
      very different cycle because we launched at a different time than usual and
      so we had an initial part of the quarter where obviously we didn''t have the
      new phones and then as we launched the new phones, we also did the channel field
      that typically happens to a certain extent in the September quarter. At the
      end of the quarter, the demand has been very strong, and so we''ve been constrained,
      as I said, especially in the Pro models. At the end of December, we exited with
      a level of iPhone channel inventory, which was slightly below a year ago. So
      we, you know, and we still had some level of supply constraints, which we believe
      we''re going to be able to solve during the March quarter. In terms of the sequential
      change, we talked about You know, during the prepare remarks, we talked about
      total company average and we said that we expect that sequential progression
      to be similar to the typical seasonality that you''ve seen in past years. Certainly
      last year is not typical because of COVID, but if you go back. you know, fiscal
      17, 18, 19, you know, that''s our typical seasonal progression. And we mentioned
      a couple of product categories, services, and wearables where we''re going to
      be having a slightly more difficult compare. And so I think you can draw your
      conclusions around iPhone. Okay. Thank you for that. And then, Tim, I was wondering
      if you could just comment more broadly around growth for Apple and sources of
      growth. The company this year is going to be well over $300 billion in revenue.
      Historically, you''ve eschewed acquisitions. And I''m wondering if you could
      comment whether you still feel confident that Apple has Apple organic growth
      opportunities and that you don''t believe acquisitions are an important source
      of growth. And then I think perhaps most importantly, as you look out, let''s
      say, over the next five years, what do you think is a realistic revenue growth
      rate for Apple going forward? Thank you. Yeah, Tony, as you know, we give some
      color on the current quarter, but not beyond that in terms of growth rates.
      So I''ll punt that part of your question. But if you back up and look at the
      sort of the ingredients that we have at this point, we have the strongest hardware
      portfolio that we''ve ever had. And we have a great product pipeline for the
      future, both in products and in services. We have an install base that has hit
      new highs that we just talked about earlier in our opening comments. And we''re
      still attracting a fair number of switchers. And of course, upgraders. We just
      set an all time services record. And we have that install base to compound that,
      and particularly with the added services that we''ve had over the last year
      or so, that as they grow and mature will contribute even more to the services
      revenue stream. And on the wearable side, we''ve brought this thing from zero
      to a Fortune 120 company. which was no small feat, but I still think that we''re
      in the early stages of those products. If you look at our share in some of the
      other products, whether you look at iPhone or Mac or iPad, you find that the
      share numbers leave a fair amount of headroom. for market share expansion. And
      this is particularly the case in some of the emerging markets where we''re proud
      of how we''ve done. But there''s a lot more headroom in those markets. Like,
      if you take India as an example, we doubled our business last quarter compared
      to the year ago quarter. But our absolute level of business there is still quite
      low relative to the size of the opportunity. And you can kind of take that and
      go around the world and find other markets that are like that as well. And,
      of course, the other thing from a market point of view is we''ve been on a multiyear
      effort in the enterprise and have gained quite a bit of traction there. You''ve
      heard some of the things in Lucas'' comments today, and we comment some on it
      each quarter. you know, very optimistic about what we can do in that space.
      And then, of course, we''ve got new things that we''re not going to talk about
      that we think will contribute to the company as well, just like other new things
      have contributed nicely to the company in the past. So we see lots of opportunity.
      Thank you for the question. Thank you. Thank you. Can we have the next question,
      please? Yes, we''ll hear from Amit Daryanani with Evercore ISI. Please go ahead.
      Perfect. Thank you. I have two questions as well. Starting with you, Luca, I
      just wanted to go back to the gross margin discussion. We really haven''t seen
      gross margins at this level, high 39, I think since 2016. Could you maybe step
      back and talk about what has enabled the shift higher? What are the key drivers
      to get you there? And, you know, it''s commodity tailwinds or insourcing of
      some components really a big part of this. So just love to understand the durability
      of the gross margin at these levels and what are the big drivers that got us
      here? Of course when you know when you grow the way we''ve grown this you know
      this quarter 21 percent and it''s obviously we have a certain level of fixed
      cost in our product structures right and so you know high level of sales helps
      margin expansion without a doubt and so that has been probably the biggest factor
      to be honest and then As I was saying earlier, we''ve had across the board in
      services, in every product category, we''ve had a very strong mix of products.
      We were talking about the iPhone, the Pro and the Pro Max, and that''s been
      pretty much the case in every product category. So the mix has also been very
      good. The commodity environment is fairly benign. And the one thing that has
      not affected us this time around is the effects that it''s true, it has not
      been a tailwind yet for the reasons that I was explaining to Katie, but at the
      same time, it has not been a negative. And the reality is that effects for us
      has been a negative over the last five or six years, almost every quarter. And
      so that has changed and that obviously makes a difference. Don''t let this be
      you during the holidays. Search it offers the most up-to-date CPE catalog with
      more than 10,000 CPE credits across hundreds of topics. So get it done. Find
      the courses you need to stay ahead. Got it. And then, Tim, when I look at the
      growth rates on Mac and iPads, they''ve been in the 20 to 40% range for the
      last three quarters. And I suspect some of this is just folks contending with
      the pandemic. But I''d love to understand, when you look at these growth rates,
      how much of this do you think is replacement cycle-driven folks upgrading what
      they have at home versus new customers and new folks that are coming into the
      Apple ecosystem? And do you see, I guess, what sort of growth rates do you think
      is more durable or predictable as we go forward over here? If you look at the
      switcher or the switcher, if you look at the new to Mac and new to iPad, these
      numbers are still about, at a worldwide level, about half of the purchases are
      coming from people that are new. And so the install base is still expanding
      with new customers in it. And so that''s true on both iPad and Mac. If you look
      at Mac, the M1, I think, gives us, a new growth trajectory that we haven''t
      had in the past. Certainly, if Q1 is a good proxy, there''s lots of excitement
      about M1-based MACs. As you know, we''re partly through the transition. We''ve
      got more A lot more to do there. We''re, you know, early days of a two-year
      transition. But we''re excited about what we see so far. The iPad, as we went
      out with the iPad Air, and we now have the best iPad lineup we''ve ever had.
      And it''s clear that some people are using these as laptop replacements. Others
      are using them as complementary to their desktop. the level of growth there
      has been phenomenal. You look at it at 41 percent. And, yes, part of it is work
      from home, and part of it is just learning. But I think I wouldn''t underestimate
      how much of it is the product itself in both the case of iPad and Mac. And,
      of course, our share in the Mac is quite low. In the for the total personal
      computer market, and so there''s lots of lots of headroom there. Perfect. Thank
      you and congrats on the great quarter. Thank you. Thanks on it. Can we have
      the next question, please? Go ahead and take our next question from Chatterjee
      with JP Morgan. Hi, thanks for taking my question and congrats on the record,
      Korto, from my side as well. I guess I wanted to start off with iPhone sales.
      I think in general impression we have is China and North America have more robust
      5G infrastructure. I just wanted to see kind of what you''re seeing in terms
      of customer engagement or velocity of sales for iPhone in Europe where I think
      the general impression is that service providers haven''t rolled out robust
      5G. So this is that something that''s impacting customer interest in the latest
      lineup in the region. And I have a follow-up. Thank you. If you look at the
      5G rollout in Europe, it''s true that Europe is not in the place of certainly
      nowhere close to where China is and nowhere close to the US either. But there
      are other regions that 5G is that has very good coverage, like Korea as an example.
      And so the world I would describe it right now is more of a patchwork quilt.
      There are places that there''s really excellent coverage. There are places where
      within a country that is very good, but not from a nationwide point of view.
      And then there are places that really hasn''t gotten started yet. Latin America
      is more closer to the last one. There''s lots of opportunity ahead of us there.
      And I think Europe is where there are 5G implementations there. I think most
      of that growth is probably in front of us there as well. Got it. As a follow-up,
      if I can just ask you, I think you mentioned the momentum you''re seeing for
      the Apple One bundle. which I think has been a couple of months now since you
      launched it. Any metrics to share in terms of what you''re seeing for conversion
      rate of customers or even insights into which services are turning in that bundle
      are turning out to be the anchor services that''s driving adoption of that bundle?
      It''s really too early to answer some of those questions. As you know, we just
      got started into the quarter. In Q1, so we have less than a quarter on this
      right now. What we wanted to accomplish with it, we''re clearly accomplishing,
      which is making our services very easy to subscribe to. Our customers clearly
      told us that they wanted to subscribe to several services, or in some cases,
      all of our services. And so, we''ve made that very simple, and it''s clear from
      the early going that it''s working. But we''ve just gotten started on it. Thanks,
      Amit. Can we have the next question, please? We''ll hear from Krish Shankar
      with Howin. Hi. Thanks for taking my question, and congratulations on the very
      strong results. My first question is for Tim. Tim, I want to talk a little bit
      about your search and advertising business. How do you think of the long-term
      growth opportunities in advertising? How do you think it, how long can it grow
      at two to three times the app store growth rate? And also, are there any applications
      where your fundamental search technology, they are infused to be adapted for
      other parts of the services business? That''s the first question, and then I
      have a quick follow-up from Luca after that. The search advertising business
      is going well. It''s a, you know, there''s lots of intent from search, and we
      do it in a very, private kind of manner, observing great privacy policies and
      so forth. And I think people see that and are willing to try it out. And we
      have been growing nicely in that area. It''s a part of the advertising area
      that Luca spoke of earlier. Got it. Got it. Thanks, Tim. I''m going to follow
      up for Luca. When you look at your services segment in the March quarter in
      China, you typically see a bump due to gaming downloads in Chinese New Year.
      So should we see a similar trend this time around? Do you think with the pandemic
      and people staying at home, that kind of seasonal bump might not happen in China
      for gaming downloads? Yeah, I mean, and I think I was mentioning it during the
      prepared remarks. Clearly in China the March quarter is typically the strongest
      quarter for our for our services business and for the app store because of Chinese
      New Year as you mentioned and last year what What we saw was an increased level
      of activity because after Chinese New Year, the whole country went into lockdown
      for several weeks. And so that propensity for playing games continued for several
      weeks, more than a typical cycle. So we expect to have a great quarter in China,
      but At the same time, you need to keep in mind that the compare is going to
      be particularly challenging because of what happened a year ago. Thanks, Luca.
      Thank you. Can we have the next question, please? We''ll go ahead and take our
      next question from Chris Casso with Raymond James. Please go ahead. Yes, thank
      you. First question is on iPhone ASPs, and I know you don''t disclose them,
      the numbers there, but I wish, I wonder if you could speak about it qualitatively.
      You spoke about the richer mix, but there were also some price differences as
      compared to a year ago. iPhone 12 came in at a higher price point. The Pro established
      a new price point. Can you speak to how that, you know, the level of benefit
      that you saw there? and going forward, are you confident that you can continue
      to improve the mix in iPhone going forward? So as I said earlier, we grew iPhone
      revenue 17% and that growth came from both unit sales and ASPs because of the
      strong mix that I mentioned before. So I think that answers your question for
      the December quarter. What we''ve seen so far, it''s very early because we launched
      the new products only a few weeks ago. What we''ve seen so far is a very high
      level of interest for the Pro models, the Pro and the Pro Max. We worked very
      hard to ramp up our supply. some supply constraints during the December quarter.
      We think we''re gonna be able to solve them during the March quarter. But so
      far, the mix has been very, very strong on iPhone. As a follow-up question,
      if you could talk a bit to the benefit that you may have seen from some of the
      carrier actions, some very aggressive trade-ins during the quarter. Did that
      provide a benefit in your view on units or mix or perhaps both? And what would
      be the level of permanence that you would see in some of those actions such
      that if those subsidies were removed, could that potentially be a headwind going
      forward? I think, Chris, it''s Tim. I think subsidies always help. Anything
      that reduces the price to the customer is good for the customer and obviously
      good for the carrier that''s doing it and good for us as well. And so, it''s
      a win across the board. I believe that at least based on what I see right now
      is that there would be probably continuing to have quite a bit of competition
      in the market if you''re talking about the U.S. market for customers as the
      carriers work to get more customers to move to 5G. In outside of of the U.S.,
      the subsidies are not used in all geographies, and so it really varies greatly
      by country. You know, some of them are separate completely, the handset and
      the service, and in those areas, we don''t have subsidies. It''s in our name
      where fires don''t complete auto care. That''s Saul. He''s a store manager and
      Saul knows there''s no job too big or small for our expert technicians. We do
      everything. Yep. Fires don''t complete auto care, helping our neighbors since
      1926. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please? Yes, we''ll go ahead and
      go ahead and hear from Jim Suba with Citigroup. Thank you very much. It''s amazing
      how your company has pivoted and progressed through this uncertain time in society.
      A lot of the pushback we get on our view on Apple is that everyone around them
      or that they know and develop countries have an iPhone or Apple product and
      the market is kind of being saturated some. But when I look at other countries
      like India, I believe statistically you are materially below that in market
      share. So are you doing active efforts there? It seems like there''s been some
      news reports of moving supply chain there, or you recently opened up an Apple
      Store. How should we think about that? Because it just seems like you really
      not full market share equally around the world. Yeah, there are several markets
      as I alluded to before India is one of those where our share is quite low. It''s
      it did improve from the year ago quarter. Our business roughly doubled. over
      that period of time. And so, we feel very good about the trajectory. We are
      doing a number of things in the area. We put the online store there, for example,
      and last quarter was the first full quarter of the online store. And that has
      gotten a great reaction to it and has helped us achieve the results that we
      got to last quarter. We''re also going in there with retail stores in the future.
      And so we look for that to be another great initiative and we continue to develop
      the channel as well. And so there''s lots of things, not only in India, but
      in several of the other markets that you might name where our share is lower
      than we would like. And I, again, I would also say, even in the developed markets,
      when you look at our share, definitely everybody doesn''t have an iPhone, not
      even close. And so, you know, we really don''t have a significant share in any
      market. We''re \u2013 they said there''s a headroom left even in those developed
      markets where you might hear that. Thank you so much, and congratulations to
      your team and employees. Thank you, Jim. Appreciate that. Thank you. A replay
