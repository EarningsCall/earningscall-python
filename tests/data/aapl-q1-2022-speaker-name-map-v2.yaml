      "Thank you, Tejas. Good afternoon, everyone, and thanks for joining us. Today
      we''re reporting revenue of $117.2 billion for the December quarter. We set
      all-time revenue records in a number of markets, including Canada, Indonesia,
      Mexico, Spain, Turkey, and Vietnam, along with quarterly records in Brazil and
      India. As a result of a challenging environment, our revenue was down 5% year
      over year. But I''m proud of the way we have navigated circumstances seen and
      unforeseen over the past several years, and I remain incredibly confident in
      our team, in our mission, and in the work we do every day. Let me discuss the
      three factors that impacted our revenue performance during the quarter. The
      first was foreign exchange headwinds, which had a nearly 800 basis point impact.
      On a constant currency basis, we grew year over year and would have grown in
      the vast majority of the markets we track. The second factor, which we described
      in a November 6th update, was COVID-19-related challenges, which significantly
      impacted the supply of iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max and lasted through
      most of December. Because of these constraints, we had significantly less iPhone
      14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max supply than we planned, causing ship times to extend
      far beyond what we had anticipated. As we always have every step of the way
      throughout the pandemic, we continue to prioritize people and work with our
      suppliers to ensure the health and safety of every worker. Production is now
      back where we want it to be. The third factor was a challenging macroeconomic
      environment as the world continues to face unprecedented circumstances from
      inflation to war in Eastern Europe to the enduring impacts of the pandemic.
      And we know that Apple is not immune to it. But whatever conditions we face,
      our approach is always the same. We are thoughtful and deliberate. We manage
      for the long term. We adapt quickly to circumstances outside our control while
      delivering with excellence in the things we can. We invest in innovation, in
      people, and in the positive difference we can make in the world. And we do it
      all to provide our customers with technology that will enrich their lives and
      help unlock their full creative potential. It''s a wonderful thing to be a part
      of, and it''s so rewarding for all of us at Apple when we hear how much our
      customers are loving what we create. Let me talk now about what we saw across
      our product categories. Starting with iPhone, revenue came in at $65.8 billion
      for the quarter, down 8% year over year. However, on a constant currency basis,
      iPhone revenue was roughly flat. Our customers continue to rave about the astounding
      camera capabilities and unprecedented battery life and the groundbreaking suite
      of health and safety features. The iPhone 14 lineup pushes the limits of what
      users can do with a smartphone. During the quarter, Mac revenue came in at $7.7
      billion, which was in line with what we had expected. We had a difficult compare
      because this time last year we had the extremely successful launch of the redesigned
      M1 MacBook Pros. We also faced a challenging macroeconomic environment and foreign
      exchange headwinds. We remain confident in and focused on the long-term opportunity
      for Mac. Just last month, we introduced new MacBook Pro models powered by our
      latest developments in Apple silicon, M2 Pro and M2 Max. These chips enable
      unprecedented performance and do so with less energy, which is not only good
      for the environment, but gives the newest MacBook Pro the longest battery life
      ever in a Mac. We also introduced the M2-powered Mac Mini, which will supercharge
      productivity for users of all kinds and leave them stunned by just how powerful
      a Mac Mini can be. During the quarter, iPad revenue grew 30% to a total of $9.4
      billion. The very strong growth was due in part to a favorable compare to the
      December quarter a year ago when we experienced significant supply constraints.
      Customers continue to praise our new lineup for its versatility, whether it''s
      the new iPad Pro, now powered by the M2, or the newly designed iPad 10th generation
      with its stunning liquid retina display and beautiful colors. Revenue for wearables,
      home, and accessories was $13.5 billion, which was down 8% year over year, driven
      by foreign exchange headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic environment. We
      remain excited about the long-term opportunity in the category. As an example,
      a few weeks ago, we announced the Next Generation HomePod, which is an indispensable
      addition to the smart home. This powerful smart speaker relies on advanced computational
      audio to produce an incredible listening experience. We''re also helping users
      make their home safer with sound recognition. This feature, arriving later this
      spring, allows HomePod to send a notification directly to a user''s iPhone if
      a smoke or carbon monoxide alarm sound is identified. We continue to hear wide
      praise for Apple Watch Series 8 and Apple Watch Ultra, which has set a new standard
      for what''s possible with a wearable. From a whole host of health and safety
      features to incredible new capabilities for extreme athletes, there is something
      for everyone in these amazing products. Customers are excited about some phenomenal
      new features we''ve made available across many of our products as well. One
      of the highlights is emergency SOS via satellite, which launched for iPhone
      14 customers in the US and Canada in November, and for customers in France,
      Germany, Ireland, and the UK in December. This is a feature we hope our users
      will never need, but it is incredibly heartening to get emails from people describing
      the life-saving impact our new safety features have had on them. We''re always
      looking for new ways to empower people to create and collaborate. In December,
      we released Freeform, a brand new app that lets users take their ideas wherever
      they want, anywhere they are, all while collaborating in real time. Freeform
      has already received praise from reviewers for its flexibility and simplicity
      as it works seamlessly across iPhone, iPad, and Mac. Today, we are very excited
      to announce that we''ve achieved a truly incredible milestone. Thanks to our
      deep commitment to innovation, incredible customer loyalty and satisfaction,
      and a large number of switchers, we now have more than 2 billion active devices
      as part of our growing installed base, double what it was just seven years ago.
      This is an incredible testament to our products and services and the strength
      of our ecosystem. We set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion in services,
      which was better than what we had expected. We achieved double-digit revenue
      growth from App Store subscriptions and set all-time revenue records across
      a number of categories, including cloud and payment services. All told, Apple
      now has more than 935 million paid subscriptions. Apple has also just begun
      a historic 10-year partnership with Major League Soccer. Just yesterday, we
      launched MLS Season Pass, which will give fans in more than 100 countries access
      to every live MLS regular season game, as well as the playoffs and MLS Cup,
      all with no blackouts. And while we''re providing more content to sports fans
      than ever before, Apple TV Plus continues to showcase powerful characters and
      moving storytelling. We were thrilled to celebrate the holidays alongside our
      Apple TV Plus subscribers with the hit movie Spirited, and we''re delighted
      to see how much people are enjoying new and returning series like Shrinking,
      Slow Horses, and Truth Be Told. and we have some great upcoming movies in Sharper
      and Tetris, along with Emmy Award winner Ted Lasso returning this spring. During
      the quarter, we made some great updates to Fitness Plus as well, expanding our
      catalog of more than 3,500 workouts and meditations to include a new kickboxing
      category and a new sleep theme for meditations. Our latest artist spotlight
      series features the music of the incomparable Beyonce, and we''re excited to
      take a stroll with guests appearing on our fifth season of Time to Walk. And
      we continue to build on our decades-long commitment to helping small businesses
      thrive when we announced Apple Business Connect. This new tool gives business
      owners even more control over how billions of people see and engage with their
      products and services every day. Businesses of all sizes can now customize key
      information for users across Apple Maps, Messages, Wallet, Siri, and other apps.
      Meanwhile, in retail, we celebrated 25 years of the Apple online store and also
      opened Apple Pacific Center in Vancouver and Apple American Dream in New Jersey.
      And I''m grateful to all the teams who helped our customers throughout the busy
      holiday season. At Apple, we spend a lot of time focused on creating an unparalleled
      experience for our customers in every product and service that we offer. We''re
      also just as dedicated to leading with our values in everything we do. As part
      of that work, we strengthened our deep commitment to privacy and security, giving
      users three new tools to protect their most sensitive data. iMessage contact
      key verification, security keys for Apple ID, and advanced data protection for
      iCloud. At Apple, we feel a deep sense of responsibility to leave the world
      better than we found it. We''re also a year closer to 2030, and we remain ever
      focused on the environmental commitments we set out for the end of the decade.
      As an example, the latest Mac Mini and MacBook Pro models all use 100% recycled
      aluminum in the enclosure and recycled rare earth elements in all magnets. And
      in a first for HomePod, we''re using 100% recycled gold in the plating of multiple
      printed circuit boards. In honor of Black History Month, we released the Black
      Unity Collection, including the special edition Apple Watch Black Unity Sport
      Loop, a new matching watch face, and iPhone wallpaper. Through our racial equity
      and justice initiative, we''re expanding our support of five organizations focused
      on lifting up communities of color through technology. And we are committed,
      as ever, to building on our progress around inclusion and diversity. During
      the quarter, we also announced that since the inception of our giving program
      11 years ago, we''ve donated more than $880 million to humanitarian efforts,
      disaster relief, childhood education, and more. And over the last 16 years through
      our partnership with REDD, Apple supported grants have helped more than 11 million
      people get the care and support services they need. As we look ahead in 2023,
      we are excited about the year to come. At Apple, we are always looking forward,
      always focused on the next challenge, always determined to do great things with
      unmatched creativity and unrivaled innovation. And that makes me more confident
      about the future of Apple than I have ever been. With that, I''ll turn it over
      to Luca."}, {"speaker": "spk05", "text": "Thank you Tim, and good afternoon
      everyone. As Tim mentioned, revenue for the December quarter was $117.2 billion,
      down 5% from last year. A number of factors had a significant impact on our
      results. First, we faced a very difficult foreign exchange environment, which
      affected our performance by nearly 800 basis points. In other words, we grew
      revenue on a constant currency basis, and in fact, we did so in the vast majority
      of markets. Second, the macroeconomic environment this past quarter was markedly
      more challenging than 12 months ago. Third, we experienced significant supply
      shortages for iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max in November and through December.
      On the other hand, we had the positive impact of the 14th week in the quarter
      that Tejas mentioned at the beginning of the call. Products revenue was 96.4
      billion, down 8% from last year due to the factors I just called out. At the
      same time, however, our installed base of active devices grew double digits
      and achieved all-time records in each geographic segment and in each major product
      category. We are proud to now have over 2 billion active devices in our installed
      base. This continued growth in the installed base is due to extremely strong
      levels of customer satisfaction and loyalty and a high number of customers who
      are new to our products. The installed base growth also helped our services
      set an all-time revenue record of $20.8 billion, up 6% over a year ago. We achieved
      this new milestone despite more than 700 basis points of negative impact from
      foreign exchange. We reached all-time services revenue records in the Americas,
      Europe, and rest of Asia Pacific, and a December quarter record in Greater China.
      We also set records in many services categories, including all-time revenue
      records for cloud services, payment services, and music, and December quarter
      records for the App Store and AppleCare. Company gross margin was 43%, up 70
      basis points from last quarter, due to leverage and favorable mix, partially
      offset by foreign exchange. Products gross margin was 37%, up 240 basis points
      sequentially, and services gross margin was 70.8%, up 30 basis points sequentially,
      both due to the same factors that impacted total company gross margin. Operating
      expenses of 14.3 billion were significantly below the guidance range we provided
      at the beginning of the quarter, and grew at a slower pace than in the past,
      as we took actions to respond to the current macro environment. Net income was
      30 billion, diluted earnings per share were $1.88, and we generated very strong
      operating cash flow of 34 billion. Let me now get into more detail for each
      of our revenue categories. iPhone revenue was $65.8 billion, despite significant
      foreign exchange headwinds, supply constraints on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14
      Pro Max, and a challenging microeconomic environment. In spite of these circumstances,
      we set all-time iPhone revenue records in Canada, Italy, and Spain, and saw
      strong growth in several emerging markets, including all-time iPhone revenue
      records for India and Vietnam. Importantly, the installed base of active iPhones
      continues to grow nicely and is at an all-time high across all geographic segments.
      In emerging markets in particular, the installed base grew double digits, and
      we had record levels of switchers in India and in Mexico. Our customers continue
      to love their experience with our products, with the latest survey of US consumers
      from 451 Research indicating customer satisfaction of 98% for the iPhone 14
      family. Mac revenue was $7.7 billion, down 29% year-over-year and in line with
      our expectations. There were three key drivers for our Mac results. First, we
      had a challenging compare against last year''s launch of the completely reimagined
      MacBook Pros, our first notebooks with M1 Pro and M1 Macs. Second, we believe
      that the macro environment impacted our Mac performance. And third, we faced
      significant foreign exchange headwinds. At the same time, however, the installed
      base of active Macs reached an all-time high across all geographic segments.
      And we continue to see very strong upgraded activity to Apple Silicon. Customer
      satisfaction with Mac remains very strong at 96% based on the latest survey
      of US consumers from 451 research. iPad revenue was $9.4 billion, up 30% year-over-year,
      despite significant FX headwinds. This performance was driven by two key items.
      First, during the December quarter a year ago, we experienced significant supply
      constraints, while this year we had enough supply to meet demand. Second, we
      launched our new iPad and the iPad Pro powered by the M2 chip during the quarter.
      The iPad install base reached a new all-time high thanks to incredible customer
      loyalty and a high number of new customers. In fact, over half of the customers
      who purchased iPads during the quarter were new to the product. Wearables, home,
      and accessories revenue was $13.5 billion, down 8% year over year. The year-over-year
      decline was driven by significant FX headwinds and a challenging macroeconomic
      environment. However, our installed base of devices in the category set a new
      all-time record thanks to the largest number of customers new to a smartwatch
      that we''ve ever had in a given quarter. In fact, nearly two-thirds of customers
      purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter were new to the product. Moving
      to services, we generated $20.8 billion in revenue, a new all-time record in
      total and for many services offerings, in spite of a difficult foreign exchange
      environment, and macroeconomic headwinds impacting certain categories such as
      digital advertising and mobile gaming. In constant currency, we grew services
      revenue double digits on top of growing 24% during the December quarter a year
      ago. We remain focused on the large long-term opportunity in this category,
      and we continue to observe several trends that reflect the strength of our ecosystem.
      For example, we saw increased customer engagement with our services during the
      quarter. Both our transacting accounts and paid accounts grew double digits
      year over year, each setting a new all-time record. Paid subscriptions also
      continue to grow nicely. We now have more than 935 million paid subscriptions
      across the services on our platform, up more than 150 million during the last
      12 months alone, and nearly four times what we had just five years ago. and
      we continue to increase the reach and improve the quality of our offerings.
      For instance, Apple Pay is now available to millions of merchants in nearly
      70 countries and regions, and we saw a record-breaking number of purchases made
      using Apple Pay globally during the holiday shopping season. Finally, our installed
      base of over 2 billion active devices represents a great foundation for future
      expansion of our ecosystem. And it continues to grow even during difficult macroeconomic
      conditions, which speaks to the exceptionally high levels of customer loyalty
      and satisfaction and our ability to attract new customers to our platform. The
      growth is coming from every major product category and geographic segment, with
      strong double-digit increases in emerging markets, such as Brazil, Mexico, India,
      Indonesia, Thailand, and Vietnam. Turning to the enterprise market, we are seeing
      continued adoption of our services for business. like Apple Business Essentials,
      AppleCare, Tap2Pay, and Apple Financial Services. For example, Mars Incorporated
      has expanded its use of AppleCare for Enterprise to provide timely device support
      and assurance for iPads deployed across their manufacturing sites. Meanwhile,
      HCA Healthcare has leveraged Apple Financial Services to manage the annual refresh
      of its entire fleet of iPhones. This not only ensures that their staff stay
      current on the latest Apple technology, but also provides them with significant
      annual savings in the process. Let me now turn to our capital return program
      and our cash position. We returned over $25 billion to shareholders during the
      December quarter as our business continues to generate very strong cash flow.
      This included $3.8 billion in dividends and equivalents and $19 billion through
      open market repurchases of 133 million Apple shares. We ended the quarter with
      $165 billion in cash and marketable securities. We repaid $1.4 billion in maturing
      debt and decreased commercial paper by $8.2 billion, leaving us with total debt
      of $111 billion. As a result, net cash was $54 billion at the end of the quarter,
      and we maintain our goal of becoming net cash neutral over time. As we move
      into the March quarter, I''d like to review our outlook, which includes the
      types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning
      of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term,
      we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights
      based on the assumption that the microeconomic outlook and COVID-related impacts
      to our business do not worsen from what we are projecting today for the current
      quarter. In total, we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance
      to be similar to the December quarter. This represents an acceleration in our
      underlying year-over-year business performance as the December quarter benefited
      from an extra week. For an exchange, we''ll continue to be a headwind, and we
      expect a negative year-over-year impact of five percentage points. For services,
      we expect revenue to grow year-over-year, while continuing to face macroeconomic
      headwinds in areas such as digital advertising and mobile gaming. For iPhone,
      we expect our March quarter year-over-year revenue performance to accelerate
      relative to the December quarter year-over-year revenue performance. For Mac
      and iPad, we expect revenue for both product categories to decline double digits
      year-over-year because of challenging compares and macroeconomic headwinds.
      We expect gross margin to be between 43.5% and 44.5%. We expect OPEX to be between
      $13.7 and $13.9 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $100 million,
      excluding any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments,
      and our tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our board of directors has
      declared a cash dividend of 23 cents per share of common stock, payable on February
      16, 2023, to shareholders of record as of February 13, 2023. With that, let''s
      open the call to questions."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Thank you, Luca.
      We ask that you limit yourself to two questions. Operator, may we have the first
      question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Certainly. We will go ahead
      and take our first question from David Bott with UBS."}, {"speaker": "spk10",
      "text": "Great. Thanks, guys, for taking my question. So, Tim, and maybe this
      is for Luca as well, you talked about the supply chain returning back to normal
      after a very difficult October-November, but we''re still seeing some disruptions
      across tech products, whether it''s enterprise or consumer-facing. How do you
      think about your supply chain and maybe the levels of inventory or bills that
      you might need as we go forward to sort of insulate your business from these
      sort of episodic disruptions? Have you changed your view? And if so, how does
      that affect ultimately margins and sort of your balance sheet and cash flow
      items going forward? Thanks."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "This is Tim, David.
      From a supply point of view, we did see disruption from early November through
      most of December. And from a supply chain point of view, We''re now at a point
      where production is what we need it to be, and so the problem is behind us.
      In terms of going forward in the supply chain, we build our products everywhere.
      There are component parts coming from many different countries in the world
      and the final assembly coming from from three countries in the world on just
      iPhone. And so we continue to optimize it. We''ll continue to optimize it over
      time and change it to continue to improve. I think when you sort of zoom out
      and back up from it, the last three years have been a pretty difficult time
      between COVID and silicon shortages and the like, and I think we have had a
      very resilient supply chain in the aggregate. In terms of supply for this quarter,
      which I think was one of your points, I think we''re in decent supply on most
      products for the quarter currently."}, {"speaker": "spk13", "text": "Great,
      thank you."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Yeah."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text":
      "Great. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk12",
      "text": "Our next question is from Shannon Cross of Credit Suisse."}, {"speaker":
      "spk11", "text": "Thank you very much. Luca, I wanted to dig a bit more into
      the commentary on gross margin. The guidance, especially 43.5 to 44.5 is obviously
      quite strong. So I''m wondering what''s helping you out there? some mix and
      some other things. And then, you know, how should we think about what currency
      and hedging is going to do as we look forward? And then I have a follow-up."},
      {"speaker": "spk05", "text": "Shannon? Yes, I mean, we''ve had good margin for
      the December quarter to start with. We reported 43%. Obviously, in December,
      we have the benefit of leverage because of the seasonality of the business.
      But we also had favorable mix across the board. Of course, foreign exchange
      is an issue right now. In the December quarter, on a sequential basis, foreign
      exchange was a negative 110 basis points for us. And on a year-over-year basis,
      it''s 300 basis points. So obviously, the FX environment has changed a lot during
      the last 12 months. For March, yeah, we''ve seen a margin expansion, 43.5% to
      44.5%. We''re doing a lot of work around cost, of course, you know, mix will
      continue to help both within categories and services mix as we move away from
      the holiday season. But we''re doing a lot of work on the cost structure, and
      that is paying off. Foreign exchange is still a negative, about 50 basis points
      sequentially, but it''s mitigating. The last couple of weeks, the dollar has
      weakened a bit. And so hopefully, as we go through the year, hopefully things
      will improve. But for now, as you correctly state, we are in a good position
      on margins."}, {"speaker": "spk11", "text": "Thank you. And then, Tim, can you
      talk a bit about China, what you''re seeing? Obviously, you had the issues with
      production, but I mean more on the demand side. As we''ve gotten through Chinese
      New Year and the opening, I''m just wondering, are you seeing the Chinese consumer
      come back? What are they buying, and how are you thinking about your position
      there? Thank you."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Shannon, last quarter, we
      declined by 7% on a reported basis, but we actually grew on a constant currency
      basis. And that was despite some significant of the supply constraints that
      we talked about earlier. And obviously the sort of the COVID restrictions throughout
      China that happened in various different places throughout the country, uh also
      impacted the the demand during the quarter uh when you look at uh the opening
      that started happening in december we saw a marked change in traffic in our
      stores as compared to november and that followed through to demand as well and
      I don''t want to get into January. We''ve obviously for January is included
      in the guidance or the color rather that Luca provided earlier. But we did see
      a marked change from December compared to November."}, {"speaker": "spk12",
      "text": "Thank you."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Yeah. Great. Thanks, Shannon.
      Can we have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Our
      next question is from Eric Woodring of Morgan Stanley."}, {"speaker": "spk08",
      "text": "Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my questions. Maybe, Tim, first one for
      you. That $2 billion device install base figure, that''s up, I believe, 200
      million units year over year. That implies the strongest annual gain in new
      devices. And your install base is basically as far back as you''ve provided
      those data points. And so I guess my two questions are, one, can you provide
      the install base for the iPhone at year-end? And then two, is there anything
      that you see in this new cohort of users that might look different or similar
      to past cohorts, either by demographic or regions or monetization ramp? And
      then I will follow up. Thanks."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Yeah, the install
      base is now over 2 billion active devices, as you mentioned. And we set records
      across each geographic segment and major product category. And so it was a broad-based
      change. To correct one thing you said, it''s up over 150 million year over year.
      The last report we reported to be over 1.85. And so it''s 150, which we''re
      very proud of. We also saw strong double digit in several of the emerging markets,
      which is very important to us. For example, India and Brazil as just two examples.
      So very, very strong and obviously it bodes well for the future."}, {"speaker":
      "spk08", "text": "Great. Thank you for the color, Tim. And then, you know, Luca,
      obviously the December quarter was negatively impacted by the production challenges.
      Can you just maybe unpackage where channel inventory levels are today kind of
      across the iPhone broadly? And then, you know, what the data that you''re seeing
      so far this quarter is telling you about iPhone demand deferral versus kind
      of iPhone demand destruction and perhaps pushing some upgrades later into the
      year rather than into March quarter? And that''s it for me. Thanks."}, {"speaker":
      "spk01", "text": "Yeah, Eric, I''ll take that one as well. The channel inventory
      levels on iPhone, we obviously ended the December quarter below our target range,
      given the supply challenges on iPhone 14 Pro and iPhone 14 Pro Max. But as you
      think about this, keep in mind that a year ago, we also exited the December
      quarter below our target inventory range. because of supply challenges in the
      year-ago quarter. Not related, not the same issue by, just as a point. And so
      that hopefully gives you some flavor of that. In terms of what we''re seeing
      in January, we''ve included In our color that Luca provided, kind of our thinking,
      it''s very hard to estimate the recapture because you have to know exactly what
      would have happened and how many people bought down, and it takes a while to
      get those reports. in during the quarter. And so we''ve made our best guess
      at it. In terms of the sizing of the constraint in Q1, what we estimate, although
      not with precision, is that we would, I thought we believe iPhone would have
      grown during the quarter had it not been for the supply shortages. So hopefully
      that provides you a little bit of color."}, {"speaker": "spk08", "text": "Yep,
      that''s great. Thanks so much."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Thanks, Eric.
      Can we have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Our
      next question comes from Aaron Rakers of Wells Fargo."}, {"speaker": "spk02",
      "text": "Yeah, thanks for taking the question. I have two as well, if I can.
      I guess the first kind of question, just going back on the gross margin line,
      you know, pretty good guidance into this March quarter. I''m curious if you
      unpack that a little bit, specific around what you''re seeing as far as, you
      know, maybe benefits from component pricing."}, {"speaker": "spk05", "text":
      "um you know in in the guidance uh if you''re embedding any of that at this
      point yeah of course you know with our guidance we try to capture every aspect
      uh of our cost structure and obviously components are a big portion of that
      yeah so definitely that''s that''s included and keep in mind again that Foreign
      exchange, I mentioned earlier, I think to Shannon, that the sequential negative
      on FX is 50 basis points versus a year ago, it''s 270 basis points. Obviously,
      the US dollar has moved a lot over the last 12 months. So obviously, we need
      to find offsets and more to the negative FX in order to be able to provide this
      kind of guidance. And so obviously, components are a big part of that."}, {"speaker":
      "spk02", "text": "Yep. And then kind of, you know, from a strategic perspective,
      given kind of the things that we''re seeing out in some of your peer group,
      I''m curious, Tim, how you think about, you know, the role of AI in your strategy
      as far as particularly in the services segment, whether you see opportunities
      to excel monetization abilities within the paid subscriber base and whether
      or not AI is something that you''re implementing a bit more strategically there."},
      {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Yeah, it is a major focus of ours. It''s incredible
      in terms of how it can enrich customers'' lives. And you can look no further
      than some of the things that we announced in the fall with crash detection and
      fall detection. or back aways with ECG. I mean, these things have literally
      saved people''s lives. And so we see an enormous potential in this space to
      affect virtually everything we do. It''s obviously a horizontal technology,
      not a vertical. And so it will affect every product and every service that we
      have."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Thanks. Can we have the next question,
      please?"}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Certainly. Our next question comes
      from Amit Daryanani of Evercore."}, {"speaker": "spk03", "text": "Thanks for
      taking my question. Yes, the first one I have is, Tim, I think basically earlier
      comments that iPhones would have grown X the production issue would imply that
      maybe it''s a $7 billion or so impact that you had in December quarter from
      the production challenges on the high-end models. I''m sure it''s tough to see
      what happens this summer round, but I think historically when you''ve had production
      issues or things like this happen, what has the consumer behavior been typically?
      Do they tend to go down towards the lower-end models and get the phone they
      want quickly, or do they just defer their production? Just from a historical
      perspective, I think. Do you typically recover what''s deferred out, or no?"},
      {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "It''s very hard to estimate is the real answer
      because you have to know a lot of data and it''s usually only in hindsight that
      you have a more reasonable view of it. And so we put our best views in the color
      that Luca provided. That''s kind of what I would say."}, {"speaker": "spk03",
      "text": "All right. And then, you know, I guess maybe if I think about services
      as you go forward, and, you know, you''ve had really good growth in services,
      I think, over the last several years, but as you go forward in services, you
      know, what do you think drives the growth more so? Is it the expansion of your
      install base, or is it more going to be driven by, you know, our pool going
      higher for you? I''m just curious, how do you think about those two buckets
      as you go forward?"}, {"speaker": "spk05", "text": "I mean, there''s a number
      of things, and I mentioned a few of them during the call, but The first step
      is always the install base. The install base is the engine for services growth.
      And the fact that the install base is growing very nicely and it''s growing,
      you know, in a lot of emerging markets is growing even faster. That gives us,
      you know, a larger addressable pool of customers. That''s incredibly important.
      The second one is that we are seeing that the level of engagement of our customers
      already in our ecosystem continues to grow. I mentioned that both transacting
      accounts and paid accounts grew double digits. And so that bodes very well for
      the future. And we have a lot of transacting accounts that can move to paid
      accounts over time. The other aspect that is very important for us is to continue
      constantly to improve the reach and the quality of our services. And I give
      the example of Apple Pay, which it''s a great example because we started off
      primarily in the United States. Now we''ve taken it to 70 markets, millions
      of merchants. And so obviously payment services continue to set new highs all
      the time for us. And as you''ve seen over the last few years, we also launched
      new services over time, and that obviously contributes to the growth. We''re
      very excited. And when we look at the behavior of our installed base, we think
      it''s very promising for the continued growth of our services business."}, {"speaker":
      "spk07", "text": "Perfect. Thank you. Thanks, Amit. Can we have the next question,
      please?"}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Our next question comes from harsh
      Kumar Piper Sandler."}, {"speaker": "spk13", "text": "Yeah. Hey, uh, Tim, I
      had a quick question on emerging markets. Uh, it seems like you''re making a
      lot of strikes in India, uh, potentially wanted to understand the kind of share
      you have in China and India. And relative to that, what would be your aspirational,
      but sort of achievable share in iPhones in those territories, whether it''s
      units or revenues, And I was hoping to draw on your experience with what you''ve
      seen in other countries where you''ve had some longer presence."}, {"speaker":
      "spk01", "text": "And looking at the business in India, we set a quarterly revenue
      record and grew very strong double digits year over year. And so we feel very
      good about how we performed. And that''s despite the headwinds that we''ve talked
      about. Taking a step back, India is a hugely exciting market for us and is a
      major focus. We brought the online store there in 2020. We will soon bring Apple
      retail there. So we''re putting a lot of emphasis on the market. There''s been
      a lot done from a financing options and trade-ins to make products more affordable
      and give people more options to buy. And so there''s a lot going on there. We''re
      in essence taking what we learned in China years ago and how we scaled China
      and bringing that to bear. And I don''t have the exact market shares in front
      of me, but I think you would see that from a market share point of view that
      we grew around the world last quarter on iPhone, despite the challenges that
      we had on the supply side. And I wouldn''t expect to have a difference in those
      two markets."}, {"speaker": "spk13", "text": "Understood. And for my follow-up,
      I had sort of an interesting theoretical question on pricing. Assuming we get
      the CHIP Act passed and there''s a whole bunch of manufacturing that happens
      in U.S. and other territories that are potentially somewhat more expensive than
      the ones you might be in now, has the company done any studies to gauge the
      elasticity of demand relative to small price increases in your products?"},
      {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "We have experience in that, but I wouldn''t necessarily
      draw the same conclusion that you have in terms of the cost of the product.
      We don''t know at this point exactly what that will be. We''re all in in terms
      of being the largest customer for TSMC in Arizona and are very proud to take
      part in that. That''s what I would say about that."}, {"speaker": "spk13", "text":
      "Okay, fair enough. Thank you, Tim."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Yep. Thanks.
      Can we have the next question, please?"}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Sure.
      Our next question comes from Wamsi Moan of Bank of America."}, {"speaker": "spk04",
      "text": "Yes, thank you. Tim, you''ve done a phenomenal job of driving consumer
      choice towards higher-end products within your portfolio. How would you compare
      this cycle for iPhones if you were to segment the pro versus non-pro models
      versus the cycles from the past few years? And do you think this move to higher
      ASPs is sustainable, or do you think it reverses in a tighter consumer spending
      environment? I''ll have a follow-up."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "The pro
      has been a 14 pro and the 14 pro max have done extremely well up until the point
      where we had a supply shortage and couldn''t provide them, couldn''t provide
      the total of the demand. And so it''s definitely a strong pro cycle. I think
      there''s a number of reasons for that, but the most important one is always
      the product. And I think the innovations in the product speak for themselves.
      And we feel very good about the product that we announced back in September
      and are happy to now be at a point where we''re shipping to the demand."}, {"speaker":
      "spk04", "text": "Tim, do you think that this move to sort of higher ASPs that
      has happened over the last few years is sustainable or could it sustain in this
      very tough macro environment that you''ve cited?"}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text":
      "I wouldn''t want to predict, but I would say that the smartphone for us, the
      iPhone, has become so integral into people''s lives. It contains their contacts
      and their health information and their banking information and their smart home
      and so many different parts of their lives. It''s their payment vehicle and
      for many people. And so I think people are willing to really stretch to get
      the best they can afford in that category."}, {"speaker": "spk04", "text": "Okay,
      great. And, Tim, you clearly emphasize the focus and importance of the install
      base. If we think about the absolute grip of the install base from $1 billion
      to $2 billion over seven years from a device standpoint, how should we think
      about the penetration of services or the growth in paying customers on services
      over that time frame? Is that penetration rate increasing or decreasing, how
      fast is that growing relative to the growth of the overall install base?"},
      {"speaker": "spk05", "text": "It''s Luca. And yes, of course, you know, we keep
      track of that. It''s really, really important for us. Over the last seven years,
      as we''ve doubled the install base, we''ve seen a growing engagement of our
      customers on the platform. That happens, first of all, by customers transacting
      on the platform and then moving to paid accounts. So starting to pay for some
      of the services. uh that percentage of paid accounts tends to grow over time
      we''ve seen it in developed markets we see it in emerging markets and that is
      due to some of the reasons that i was explaining earlier including the fact
      that we made it easier for our for our customers to get engaged on the platform
      for example we offer multiple payment methods in in many countries uh and we''ve
      made it easier to explore for more services because we''ve added a lot of services
      on the platform over the last over the last seven years so to your question
      of course higher engagement means a higher percentage of paid accounts over
      time okay thank you all right thanks wamsi can we have the next question please"},
      {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Our next question comes from Richard Kramer of
      Crete Research, LLP."}, {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Operator, can we move
      on to the next? Richard. Okay."}, {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Next we''ll
      hear from Jim Suva of Citigroup. Jim, your line is open. If you can release
      your mute function, we are unable to hear you."}, {"speaker": "spk06", "text":
      "Tim and Luca, you both mentioned earlier on the Q&A a little bit about India.
      I was wondering if we''re now entering a situation of even more opportunity
      because we''ve exited COVID, we''ve exited countries with different COVID criteria.
      We''ve also seen India build out its higher speed transmissions and your market
      shares tremendously underrepresented there. And it appears with the supply chain,
      you''re looking at diversifying kind of operational risk, not specific to any
      country, but just overall of, you know, now you look at potentially opening
      up stores and stuff. Am I right? That that''s the way you look at it is it''s
      even more prime for opportunity now than ever. And once you start opening up
      stores there, you could just see a complete green shoot of adoptions or any
      additional commentary on your view on India as now we''ve navigated COVID and
      supply chain and so many challenges over the past two years. Thank you, gentlemen."},
      {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "Yeah, Jim, we actually did fairly well through
      COVID in India, and I''m even more bullish now on the other side of it, or hopefully
      on the other side of it. And that''s the reason why we''re investing there with
      bringing retail there and bringing the online store there and putting a significant
      amount of energy there. I''m very bullish on India."}, {"speaker": "spk06",
      "text": "Thank you. And then as my quick follow-up, you''d mentioned that services,
      not necessarily specific to India, but services overall were better than expected.
      And of course, supply chain was more challenged than expected. So what was the
      bridge factor of services being better than expected on the upside? Was it like
      advertising or apps or paid monthly subscriptions or what were kind of the things
      that really surprised you to the upside on services? Thank you."}, {"speaker":
      "spk05", "text": "It was primarily, Jim, it''s Luca. It''s primarily this level
      of engagement that we saw, which then it reflects into the As you said, the
      paid subscriptions, we saw very good results in our cloud services business,
      in payment services. Music was very strong. So we had a number of categories
      that set new records, all-time records, and they did a bit better than we were
      expecting at the beginning of the quarter. And so Tim mentioned it. during,
      I think, his prepared remarks that when you look at it in constant currency,
      we grew services double digits, and that was on top of a 24% increase a year
      ago. So it''s very sustained growth that we''re seeing."}, {"speaker": "spk06",
      "text": "Thank you so much, and congratulations to you and all your teams."},
      {"speaker": "spk07", "text": "Thanks, Jim. Can we have the next question, please?"},
      {"speaker": "spk12", "text": "Our next question will come from Chris Sankar
      of Cowan & Company."}, {"speaker": "spk09", "text": "Yeah, hi. Thanks for taking
      my question. I have two of them, too. First one, Tim or Luca, you mentioned
      how the macro did soften and had an impact. And as consumers tighten their belts,
      when you look across your hardware products and service businesses, where have
      you seen the biggest impact and where have you seen the least impact from the
      softening macro? And then I had a quick follow-up."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text":
      "We think there were some impact across the products and in services. Probably
      the ones that we saw the most impact on were Mac and wearables. You can see
      that in those numbers. And probably the least would have been iPhone."}, {"speaker":
      "spk09", "text": "Got it. Got it. Very helpful, Tim. And then just a quick follow-up
      on the MAC. You know, the PC industry is expecting decline in PC shipments this
      year also. How to think about the MAC relative to kind of like where the PC
      industry as a whole is expecting the shipments to end up? Is there any color
      you can give on that? Thank you very much."}, {"speaker": "spk01", "text": "The
      industry is very challenged, as you say. The industry is contracting. I think
      from us, though, and I don''t know how this year will play out, so I don''t
      want to predict the year, but over the long run, we have a market that is a
      reasonable-sized market, a big market, and we have low share. And we have a
      competitive advantage with Apple Silicon. And so strategically, I think we''re
      well positioned in the market, albeit I think it will be a little rough in the
      short term."}, {"speaker": "spk09", "text": "Thanks a lot, Tim."}, {"speaker":
