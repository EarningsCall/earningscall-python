      "prepared_remarks": "Good day and welcome to the Apple Q1 FY 2022 earnings conference
      call. Today''s call is being recorded. At this time, for opening remarks and
      introductions, I would like to turn the call over to Tejas Ghala, Director of
      Investor Relations and Corporate Finance. Please go ahead. Thank you. Good afternoon,
      and thank you for joining us. Speaking first today is Apple CEO Tim Cook, and
      he''ll be followed by CFO Luca Maestri. After that, we''ll open the call to
      questions from analysts. Please note that some of the information you''ll hear

      without limitation, those regarding revenue, gross margin, operating expenses,
      other income and expense, taxes, capital allocation, and future business outlook,
      including the potential impact of COVID-19 on the company''s business and results
      of operations. These statements involve risks and uncertainties that may cause
      actual results or trends to differ materially from our forecast. For more information,
      please refer to the risk factors discussed in Apple''s most recently filed annual
      report on Form 10-K and the Form 8-K filed with the SEC today, along with the
      associated press release. Apple assumes no obligation to update any forward-looking
      statements or information which speak as of their respective dates. I''d now
      like to turn the call over to Tim for introductory remarks. Thank you, Tejas,
      and good afternoon. Today we are proud to announce Apple''s biggest quarter
      ever. Through the busy holiday season, we set an all-time revenue record of
      nearly $124 billion, of 11% from last year, and better than we had expected
      at the beginning of the quarter. And we are pleased to see that our active install
      base of devices is now at a new record with more than 1.8 billion devices. We
      set all time records for both developed and emerging markets and saw revenue
      growth across all of our product categories, except for iPad, which we said
      would be supply constrained. As expected in the aggregate, we experienced supply
      constraints that were higher than the September quarter. Before I discuss our
      results in greater detail, I want to first acknowledge the toll that COVID continues
      to have on communities around the world. In many places, case counts are higher
      and health systems more strained than at any point throughout the pandemic.
      On behalf of all of us at Apple, I want to extend our deep gratitude to the
      scientists, doctors, nurses, and so many others on the front lines of combating
      COVID-19. This is our eighth quarter reporting results in the shadow of the
      pandemic. And while I can''t say it gets any easier, I can say I''m incredibly
      proud of the way our teams have come together and continue to innovate on behalf
      of our customers. A few weeks ago, we marked the 15th anniversary of the day
      Steve revealed iPhone to the world. We knew that we had the beginnings of something
      fundamentally transformative, though none of us could have predicted the incredible
      and meaningful impact it would have on all of our lives. The creative spirit
      that made the first iPhone possible has thrived at Apple every day since. We
      never stop creating. We never stop innovating. You can see that spirit reflected
      throughout our products, from the incredible performance and capability of our
      M1 chips, to our powerful yet easy to use operating systems, to our unrivaled
      iPhone camera systems, to the beauty and magic of AirPods. That''s why each
      of our major products leads the industry in customer satisfaction for their
      respective category. People expect Apple to solve hard problems with easy-to-use
      products. And iPhone has never been more popular. During the December quarter,
      we set an all-time revenue record for iPhone, thanks to the strength of our
      incredible iPhone 13 lineup. This is the best iPhone lineup we''ve ever had,
      and the reaction from the press and our users have been off the charts. This
      past quarter, we also set another all-time revenue record for Mac, with customers
      eager to get their hands on an M1-powered MacBook Air, iMac, or MacBook Pro.
      We''ve been thrilled with the response from Pro users to the M1 Pro and M1 Max
      chips, and to see how Apple Silicon is blowing them away with its power, performance,
      and efficiency. Despite the constraints I mentioned earlier, our iPad lineup
      continues to be indispensable to tens of millions of people, from teachers and
      students to artists and creators. Customers are eager to get their hands on
      our ninth generation iPad, which features a beautiful display and double the
      storage capacity, as well as the new iPad mini with its ultra portable design.
      Wearable home and accessories, meanwhile, set an all-time revenue record. Customers
      are loving the Apple Watch Series 7 with its cutting-edge health and fitness
      tracking features. Nearly every day, I get notes from customers who share how
      a heart alert led to a life-saving appointment with a cardiologist. And more
      recently, I''ve been hearing from people who tell me that their Apple Watch
      saved their lives by calling 911 when they couldn''t. As I''ve said, we''re
      still in the early innings with our health work, but every day I am encouraged
      by our positive impact. We are also making great advancements in audio and are
      seeing strong demand from customers as a result. The HomePod Mini continues
      to earn praise for combining the intelligence of Siri with an immersive, room-filling
      audio experience. And our customers have responded with a lot of excitement
      to the magic of spatial audio on AirPods, which packs the acoustics of a concert
      hall. As always, the deep integration of hardware, software, and services is
      a hallmark of everything Apple makes. It''s a principle you can see at work
      in the introduction of SharePlay, a feature that offers a whole new way to create
      shared experiences by letting users watch and listen to their favorite content
      together on FaceTime. And we continue to invest in innovation across our services
      business, which set another all-time revenue record last quarter and performed
      even better than we had anticipated. The App Store continues to be an economic
      miracle for developers around the world and a safe and trusted place for consumers
      to discover their favorite apps. Since its launch, we have paid developers selling
      digital goods and services more than $260 billion with 2021 setting a new record
      for their earnings. I''m also happy to report that in its first two years, Apple
      TV Plus shows and movies have earned 200 award wins and more than 890 nominations.
      Among the powerful lineup are feature films like The Tragedy of Macbeth, Coda,
      and Swan Song, along with many gripping new series coming up, including Severance
      and The After Party. Each one is a tremendous credit to all the storytellers
      in front of the cameras and behind them who touched audiences all over the world.
      Fitness Plus, meanwhile, continues to inspire customers to reach their health
      and fitness goals. We recently introduced Time to Run, an extension of our popular
      series Time to Walk, as well as new collections of workouts and meditations
      to help users make more intentional training choices. Despite the pandemic,
      our retail businesses saw its highest revenue in Apple''s history, and we also
      earned our highest ever customer satisfaction scores. That is a testament to
      the incredible adaptability our teams have shown as we''ve reimagined the retail
      experience. I also want to take a moment to thank our retail employees and AppleCare
      teams for the deep care you''ve given to our customers as they look to get the
      most out of our products, learn new skills, or track down the perfect gift.
      We have always led with our values and with compassion and care, and never has
      that been more needed than during the pandemic. Last quarter, we celebrated
      10 years of our employee giving program, which we started to help our employees
      identify and support the causes they care most deeply about. We pledged to match
      their contributions to organizations doing important work at every level, from
      their local food pantry to global humanitarian nonprofits. In the last decade,
      this program has contributed nearly $725 million to charitable organizations.
      We also celebrated 15 years of Apple''s partnership with the Global Fund on
      Project Red, supporting their life-saving work to expand healthcare services
      in Sub-Saharan Africa for people living with HIV AIDS. With the support of our
      customers, we''ve now raised nearly $270 million to fund prevention, testing,
      and counseling services for people impacted by HIV AIDS. And in keeping with
      our abiding belief in and commitment to education, we also launched a new partnership
      with the Boys and Girls Club of America. This initiative will help young people
      across the U.S. learn to code on iPad using our Everyone Can Code curriculum.
      And we are continuing to drive innovations to help combat climate change. We
      are already carbon neutral across our own operations and we are working intensely
      to meet our 2030 goal of carbon neutrality across our supply chain and the life
      cycle of our products. To celebrate Black History Month, we will be releasing
      a special edition Apple Watch Black Unity braided solo look and a matching Unity
      lights watch face. And through our racial equity and justice initiative, we
      are continuing to support organizations blazing trails to a more equitable world
      in our economies, our classrooms, and our criminal justice system. We recognize,
      as ever, that it takes all of us to confront our most profound challenges, and
      at Apple we are determined to do our part. That includes our own work in inclusion
      and diversity, which we are advancing every day. Let me close by saying that
      despite the uncertainty of the world, there is one thing of which I am certain.
      Apple will continue to innovate every day and in every way to deliver on the
      promise of technology at its best. I will now turn it over to Luca to go over
      our quarterly results in more detail. Thank you, Tim, and good afternoon, everyone.
      We are very pleased to report record financial results for the December quarter.
      We set an all-time revenue record of 123.9 billion, an 11% increase from a year
      ago. We reached new all-time records in the Americas, Europe, Greater China,
      and the rest of Asia Pacific. and it was also an all-time record quarter for
      both products and services. On the product side, revenue was 104.4 billion,
      up 9% over a year ago, despite significant supply constraints. We grew in each
      of our product categories, except iPad, where supply constraints were particularly
      pronounced, and set all-time records for iPhone, Mac, and wearables, home, and
      accessories. The strong level of sales performance, the unmatched loyalty of
      our customers, and the strength of our ecosystem have driven our current installed
      base of active devices to a new all-time record of 1.8 billion devices. The
      growth in this stored base was broad-based, as we set all-time records in each
      major product category and in each geographic segment. Our services set an all-time
      revenue record of $19.5 billion, up 24% over a year ago, with December quarter
      records in every geographic segment. Company gross margin was 43.8%, up 160
      basis points from last quarter, due to volume leverage and favorable mix, partially
      offset by higher cost structures. Products gross margin was 38.4%, up 410 basis
      points sequentially, driven by leverage and mix. Services gross margin was 72.4%,
      up 190 basis points sequentially, mainly due to a different mix. Net income
      of $34.6 billion and diluted earnings per share of $2.10, both grew more than
      20% year-over-year and were all-time records. Operating cash flow of $47 billion
      was also an all-time record. Let me get into more detail for each of our revenue
      categories. iPhone revenue grew 9% year-over-year to an all-time record of $71.6
      billion, despite supply constraints, thanks to a remarkable customer response
      to our new iPhone 13 family. We set all-time records in both developed and emerging
      markets, reached an all-time high in the iPhone active installed base, and the
      latest survey of US consumers from 451 Research indicates iPhone customer satisfaction
      of 98%. For Mac, revenue of 10.9 billion was an all-time record with growth
      of 25% year over year. driven by strong demand for our newly redesigned MacBook
      Pro powered by M1, despite supply constraints. We are one year into our transition
      to Apple Silicon, and already the vast majority of our Mac sales are from M1
      powered devices. which helped drive a record number of upgraders during the
      December quarter. Our momentum in this category is very impressive as the last
      six quarters have been the best six quarters ever for Mac. iPad generated 7.2
      billion in revenue, down 14% year over year due to very significant supply constraints,
      but customer demand was very strong across all models. Despite the supply shortages,
      our installed base of iPads reached a new all-time high during the quarter,
      thanks to a high number of customers that are new to iPad. In fact, around half
      of the customers purchasing an iPad during the quarter were new to the product.
      Wearables, home, and accessories set a new all-time record of 14.7 billion,
      up 13% year-over-year, and we set all-time revenue records in each geographic
      segment. We also continue to improve and expand our product offerings in this
      category to create unique experiences showcasing our deep integration of hardware,
      software, and services. In addition to an outstanding level of sales performance
      globally, Apple Watch continues to extend its reach, with over two-thirds of
      customers purchasing an Apple Watch during the quarter being new to the product.
      Turning to services, as I mentioned, we reach an all-time revenue record of
      19.5 billion, up 24%, with all-time records for cloud services, for music, video,
      advertising, and payment services, and a December quarter record for the App
      Store. These impressive results reflect the positive momentum we''re seeing
      on many fronts. First, as I mentioned before, our installed base has continued
      to grow and has reached an all-time high across each geographic segment and
      major product category. Next, we continue to see increased customer engagement
      with our services. The number of paid accounts on our digital content stores
      grew double digits and reached a new all-time high during December quarter in
      every geographic segment. Also, paid subscriptions continue to show very strong
      growth. We now have more than 785 million paid subscriptions across the services
      on our platform, which is up to 165 million during the last 12 months alone.
      And finally, we''re adding new services that we think our customers will love,
      and we continue to improve the breadth and quality of our current service offerings.
      Just in this last quarter, we''ve added incredible new content on Apple TV+,
      on Fitness+, and Apple Arcade, and a brand new way to listen to music with Apple
      Music Voice. We also announced in November the beta program for Apple Business
      Essentials, a new service offering that brings together device management, 24-7
      support, and iCloud storage to help small businesses manage the end-to-end lifecycle
      of their employees'' Apple devices. We are very excited that many thousands
      of small business customers are already actively participating in the beta program.
      This announcement is just one of many ways we''re expanding our support for
      enterprise and business customers. With the latest MacBook Pros that we''ve
      introduced last October, the new M1 powered Mac lineup has quickly become the
      preferred choice of Macs among enterprise customers. Shopify, for example, is
      upgrading its entire global workforce to M1 powered MacBook Pro and MacBook
      Air. By standardizing on M1 Macs, Shopify continues its commitment to providing
      the best tools to help its employees work productively and securely from anywhere.
      And Deloitte Consulting is expanding the deployment of the Mac Employee Choice
      program, including offering the new M1 MacBook Pro to empower their professionals
      to choose devices that work best for them in delivering consulting services.
      Let me now turn to our cash position. Due to our strong operating performance
      and holiday quarter seasonality, we ended the quarter with $203 billion in cash
      plus marketable securities. We decreased commercial paper by $1 billion, leaving
      us with total debt of $123 billion. As a result, net cash was $80 billion at
      the end of the quarter. Our business continues to generate very strong cash
      flow, and we were able to return nearly 27 billion to shareholders during the
      December quarter. This included 3.7 billion in dividends and equivalents, and
      14.4 billion through open market repurchases of 93 million Apple shares. We
      also began 6 billion accelerated share repurchase program in November, resulting
      in the initial delivery and retirement of 30 million shares. As we move ahead
      into the March quarter, I''d like to review our outlook, which includes the
      types of forward-looking information that Tejas referred to at the beginning
      of the call. Given the continued uncertainty around the world in the near term,
      we are not providing revenue guidance, but we are sharing some directional insights
      based on the assumption that the COVID-related impacts to our business do not
      worsen from what we are projecting today for the current quarter. We expect
      to achieve solid year-over-year revenue growth and set a March quarter revenue
      record despite significant supply constraints which we estimate to be less than
      what we experienced during the December quarter. We expect our revenue growth
      rate to decelerate from the December quarter primarily due to two factors. First,
      during the March quarter a year ago, we grew revenue by 54%. Remember that last
      year we launched our new iPhones during the December quarter, while this year
      we launched them during the September quarter. Due to the later launch a year
      ago, some of the associated channel inventory fill occurred during the March
      quarter last year. As a result of the different launch timing, we will face
      a more challenging year-over-year compare. Second, we expect foreign exchange
      to be a three-point headwind when compared to the December quarter growth rate.
      We currently expect FX to have a negative impact on growth of two points in
      the March quarter, while they represented a one-point benefit during the December
      quarter. Specifically related to services, we expect to grow strong double digits
      that decelerate from the December quarter performance. This is due to a more
      challenging compare because a higher level of lockdowns around the world last
      year led to increased usage of digital content and services. We expect gross
      margin to be between 42.5% and 43.5%. We expect OPEX to be between $12.5 billion
      and $12.7 billion. We expect OINE to be around negative $150 million, excluding
      any potential impact from the mark-to-market of minority investments, and our
      tax rate to be around 16%. Finally, today our board of directors has declared
      a cash dividend of $0.22 per share of common stock payable on February 10, 2022,
      to shareholders of record as of February 7, 2022. And with that, let''s open
      the call to questions. Thank you, Luca. We ask that you limit yourself to two
      questions. Operator, may we have the first question, please? Absolutely.", "questions_and_answers":
      "We''ll take our first question from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley. Caller,
      please check your mute function. We''re unable to hear you. Hearing no response,
      we''ll take our next question from Wamsi Mohan with Bank of America. Yes, thank
      you. Your margins have clearly been very impressive. So I have one question
      each on product and one on services gross margins. On product gross margins,
      that''s clearly benefiting from a very strong mix. So Tim, I''m curious, how
      sustainable do you think these mixed trends are from the data that you see?
      And can you share any thoughts across how the pro and pro max mix compared to
      prior cycles? And on the services side, if I could just ask that too, When you
      look at the gross margins there, that''s been really impressive. Can you give
      us some sense of where within services you''re seeing particularly favorable
      mixed trends, and how should investors think about their trajectory of these
      margins, given some of the sizable investments you''re making to drive very
      successful areas like content for TV Plus, for example? Thank you. Wamsi, it''s
      Tim. In terms of the mix, we don''t comment directly on mix, but what I would
      tell you is that we saw strong demand across the iPhone 13 family. And in fact,
      we had several of the top selling models in various markets, including the top
      five in the US and Australia. the top four in urban China, two of the top three
      in the UK, three of the top four in France and Germany, and four of the top
      six in Japan. And certainly based on some external data that I''ve seen, it
      does seem to say that we are gaining share as well. So we feel quite good about
      the momentum of iPhone. And I should add that we were constrained during the
      quarter. On the services side, you were asking about gross margin there. As
      you know, our services business in aggregate is accretive to overall company
      margin. And as you know, our services portfolio is very broad and it contains
      businesses with very different margin profiles. The difference in margin profile
      is due in part to the nature of those businesses and in part to the way that
      we account for them. In some cases, we account on a net basis as opposed to
      a gross basis. And so as a result, the services gross margin percentage over
      time will be influenced by by the relative growth of the different businesses
      within the portfolio. You know, we do not guide at the product and services
      level, but I think you''ve seen the guidance that we provided for the March
      quarter at the total company level, 42.5% to 43.5%, obviously very strong compared
      to our recent history, and so we''re very pleased with that. Thanks, Jim. Thanks,
      Luca. Thank you, Wamsi. Can we have the next question, please? We''ll take our
      next question from Kyle McNeely with Jefferies. Hi, thanks very much. Congrats
      on the solid iPhone result. That''s very good. I assume that you may have prioritized
      iPhone to the extent there may be similar components that are used for iPhone
      and iPad. Can you just level set me on that if that''s not the case? And if
      it is, Should we see a recovery in iPad as you move past your prime iPhone selling
      season and you may have, you know, better access to components or better supplies
      as we move through the next few months of the year? Yeah, Kyle, it''s Tim. From
      a supply constraint point of view, as you recall, we said in Q1, the December
      quarter, that we would have constraints more than six. And we clearly did have
      constraints more than six. For March, we''re saying that we will do better or
      have less constraints than we had in the December quarter. If you look at the
      commonality between different products, there is some, but generally the...
      The challenge is on legacy nodes and these legacy nodes are by supplier. And
      so it''s much more focused on the supplier than anything else and versus us
      behind the curtain, finding a place to take it. There''s not none of that, but
      there is some of that, but largely we have to take it where the shortages are.
      Okay, great. Can you give us any other color on kind of the trajectory of iPad
      and, you know, what''s impacting this quarter and where it might go in the March
      and the June quarter? Yeah, the issue with iPad, and it was a very significant
      constraint in the December quarter, was very much on these legacy nodes that
      I had talked about. Virtually all of the problem was in that area. And so, overall,
      we''re not guiding by product or constraint by product level, but at the, but
      overall, we do see an improvement in the March quarter in terms of the constraints
      going down versus what they were in the December quarter. Okay, great. Thanks
      so much. Congrats again on the results all around. Oh, thanks very much. Thank
      you, Kyle. Can we have the next question, please? Thank you. We''ll take our
      next question from Shannon Cross with Cross Research. Thank you very much. Tim,
      could you talk a bit about the Mac business? Looking back, it''s up about 50%
      from the calendar 2019 revenue. You did almost $11 billion this quarter, and
      you''re still working through the M1 transition. So can you talk about where
      you see the opportunity to gain share? What are really sort of the target markets
      that you think you can go after in order to grow this beyond 2020? I think it
      was about 37 billion in the last 12 months. Thank you. I''m going to have a
      follow-up. Yeah, Shannon, thank you for the question. MAC set an all-time revenue
      record at $10.9 billion for the quarter. That was up 25%. And as you point out,
      the last six quarters for the MAC have been the top six revenue quarters of
      all time. And what''s further very good about this is we set all-time revenue
      records in Americas, in Europe, and the rest of Asia Pacific. And we set a December
      quarter record in greater China. And so it''s not narrowed to a particular geographic
      area that we''re doing well in. It''s almost across the board. The response
      is very much because of M1. And we got even more response with the MacBook Pro
      that we launched during the Q1 time frame. Both the upgraders, which we had
      a record number of upgraders for the December quarter, but also in markets like
      China, six out of ten sales are to people new to the market. And so it''s, you
      know, powered by both upgraders and switchers. Customer satisfaction is off
      the charts. And so what I see this as is a that will a product that will be
      very successful in a number of different markets from education to business
      to the creative industry and in all geographic markets. We''re not limiting
      ourselves. Great. Thank you. And then, Luca, can you talk a bit more on services?
      Just, you know, obviously outperformed your guidance or your expectations as
      well as certainly where we were at. You know, where were the outperformings?
      What were the things that really outperformed and maybe what trends are you
      seeing that is driving the extra revenue? Thank you. Yes, Shannon. It was really
      great on all fronts. We set December quarter records in every geographic segment.
      And then, as I mentioned earlier, an all-time record for cloud, for music, for
      video, for advertising, for payment services. December quarter record in the
      app store. So we''ve done, as you said, better than we were expecting at the
      beginning of the quarter. This overperformance has been, you know, spread around
      the world and spread around our services categories. And the reality is, you
      know, this combination of factors, the fact that the install base is growing,
      the fact that We continue to have more and more engagement of our customers
      on all the services. Paid subscriptions is a phenomenal story, right? We now
      have 785 million paid subs. We''ve increased 165 million in the last 12 months
      alone, right? And so all these things combined are really powering the business.
      Very, very pleased with the performance. Okay, thank you. Thanks. Can we have
      the next question, please? We''ll hear next from Katie Huberty with Morgan Stanley.
      Thank you. Can you hear me okay? Now we can. Yes. Okay, good. So first question,
      just as it relates to some of the disruption you''ve seen on the component side,
      manufacturing and logistics over the past couple of years, are you concerned
      starting to rethink your broader supply chain strategy or the manufacturing
      footprint on the back of the significant disruption? Are you happy with the
      overall geographic exposure that you see in the supply chain today? Katie, if
      you sort of step back and look at how we''ve done this, Our largest issue by
      far has been the chip shortage that is industry wide and on these legacy nodes,
      as I had mentioned earlier. And I think our supply chain actually does very
      good considering the shortages because it''s a fast-moving supply chain. The
      cycle times are very short. There''s very little distance between a chip being
      fabricated and packaged and a product going out of factory. And so, no, I don''t
      see that it... makes a fundamental change in the supply chain. Okay, thank you.
      And how are you thinking about the metaverse opportunity and Apple''s role in
      that market? Well, that''s a big question, but we''re a company in the business
      of innovation, so we''re always exploring new and emerging technologies. And
      you''ve spoken at length about how this area is very interesting to us. Right
      now, we have over 14,000 ARKit apps in the App Store. which provide incredible
      AR experiences for millions of people today. And so we see a lot of potential
      in this space and are investing accordingly. Thank you. Congrats on the quarter.
      Thanks so much. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please? Thank you. We''ll
      take our next question from Amit Daryani with Evercore. Thanks for taking my
      question. I have two as well. I guess close up on the supply chain side, I think
      things continue to be fairly volatile. I''d love to get your perspective. Do
      you feel if things or supply chain issues are starting to alleviate or they
      still remain challenging? And then maybe I missed this, but could you perhaps
      tell us how much revenue was left on the table in December because of these
      supply chain issues? And how did that number shake over March? Yeah, Amit, what
      we''ve said in terms of December and March was that, you know, it''s very difficult
      to estimate with great precision constraints. But we said that they would be
      more than the Q4 or more than the September quarter. And we''re saying that
      March will be less than the December quarter. And so that''s the kind of verbiage
      that we placed around it. In terms of is it still challenging? Yes, it is challenging.
      And for us, we pride ourselves on getting products to customers who really want
      them and try to do that in a fast fashion. uh basis and so it''s it''s frustrating
      that we can''t always do that at the speed that that we would like uh however
      uh march is better than december and and so there''s some there''s some encouraging
      sign there we''re not predicting uh overall obviously because of the number
      of variables that that go into such a prediction Fair enough. Tim, I think one
      of the topics investors can struggle a fair bit with Apple is really just trying
      to understand visibility around your product roadmap. And I think some of your
      tech peers tend to be more vocal about their initiative. Some of them go change
      their name when they find an initiative that''s attractive, I feel. You folks
      are spending, I think, $23 billion on R&D in 2021, so you''re really spending
      a fair amount. And maybe without telling us the roadmap, can you just talk about
      how do you think about where to focus your R&D resources on? And to some extent,
      as a way to think about this R&D spend, how much of it is really done on things
      that are more evolutionary and products that are out there in the marketplace
      versus things that we haven''t seen yet around potential new offerings? You
      know, we have a little different model. We try to announce things when they''re
      ready or close to ready and try to maintain an element of surprise in there.
      And so that explains hopefully what we do with our roadmap. And I think that''s
      proven useful. successful for us and other people can do it differently, of
      course, but it''s been good for us over time to do that. So we''re going to
      continue to do that. In terms of deciding where we invest in, we look at areas
      that are sort of at the intersection of hardware, software, and services. And
      because we think that that''s where the magic really happens and it brings out
      the best in Apple. And so there are areas that have... more than piqued our
      interest, and we are investing in those. And you can tell through time that
      we''ve ramped our R&D spend even more than we were before. And so there''s quite
      a bit of investment going into things that are not on the market at this point,
      as there always are. Thanks for the question. Thank you. Thanks. Can we have
      the next question, please? Thank you. We''ll hear next from David Voigt with
      UBS. Great. Thanks for taking my call and my question. I just wanted to dive
      in and get your perspective on China and sort of the macro climate there and
      how that sort of pertains to your business as we think about it going forward.
      And the reason why I''m asking is we''ve heard some concerns that current policies
      might have caused a pause in this market and smartphone inventory has Maybe
      more specifically, the local vendors could be a little bit elevated going into
      Chinese New Year. So we''d just love to get your thoughts on what you''re seeing
      in this market around disordered potential development, and then maybe touch
      on sell-in versus sell-through in that market. And then I have a follow-up.
      Well, I can only comment on, for us, our sales grew 21% there in the last quarter,
      and we''re very proud of that. I''ll stay away and let other people be the economist
      and make the macro determinations. But what we''re seeing there was super impressive
      with all-time revenue records and a record number of upgraders and strong double
      digit growth in switchers on iPhone, which is very important to us. And as I
      mentioned before, we had the top four selling phones in urban China. And so
      there''s a lot of good there. And I would remind you that iPhone was constrained
      in the quarter. And so I''m not sure where the statements are coming around
      about inventory. And I can''t comment on whether other people have more or not.
      I don''t know the answer to that. Thanks for the question. And then maybe just
      maybe just on the supply chain, you know, obviously you''ve been managing it
      incredibly well the last 12 to 18 months and gross margins have actually performed
      relatively well, you know, mixed driven both between product and services. You
      know, can you help us think about sort of the quantifiable impact or maybe the
      cost that you''re carrying due to the supply chain that may be sort of, you
      know, I don''t want to use the word transitory, but, you know, you''d expect
      over the longer term that might be sort of a, you know, sort of a bait a little
      bit and you''ll get a little bit of a benefit as we get past some of these supply
      chain issues over the next 12 months or so. We''re seeing inflation and it''s
      factored into our gross margin and OPEX that Luca mentioned. reviewed with you
      earlier. Logistics, as I''ve mentioned on a previous call, is very elevated
      in terms of the cost of moving things around. I would hope that at least a portion
      of that is transitory, but the world has changed, and so we''ll see. Thank you.
      Yep. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please? Thank you. We''ll take a
      question from Samik Chatterjee with JP Morgan. Great. Thanks for taking my question.
      I had a couple. The first question that I had was really on Apple TV+. And I
      know some of the other players in this market have talked about slowing subscriber
      growth as we exit the pandemic. So curious if you can share what trends you''re
      seeing in Apple TV and Apple TV+. And how similar or dissimilar they are and
      how your content is maybe helping you on that aspect and have a follow-up. You
      know, we don''t give out subscriber numbers for Apple TV+. What we do do is
      give out a subscriber number for our subscription number for the total number
      of subscriptions that we had. And I think Luca mentioned earlier, we ended the
      quarter at 785 million. And so we were incredibly pleased with that. That''s
      a huge growth on a year-over-year basis of 165. And it counts, as you recall,
      both Apple-branded and third-party. In terms of how we''re doing with TV+, we''ve
      been honored with 200 wins and 890 nominations. uh we''re doing exactly like
      uh we had wanted to with giving storytellers a place to tell original stories
      and uh feel really good about uh where we are competitively and strategic position
      of the product and if i can just follow up uh and similarly on apple b um can
      you just help us think about when you think about the next few years, where
      are the biggest opportunities, either be it in terms of geographies or customer
      segments that you may not be tapping into currently and have an opportunity
      in. Thank you. Well, putting aside any kind of thing that''s on our roadmap
      for a second in that area, which we obviously wouldn''t talk about in the call,
      I would say that I think Apple Card has a great runway ahead of us. It was rated
      to the number one midsize credit card and customer set by J.D. Power and is
      getting as fast become people''s main credit card for many, many people. And
      the growth of Apple Pay has just been stunning. It''s been absolutely stunning.
      And there''s still obviously a lot more there to go. And And because there''s
      still a lot of cash in the environment. And so I think that both of these and
      whatever else we might do have a great future ahead. Congrats on the results.
      Thanks so much. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please? Thank you. We''ll
      take our next question from Chris Caso with Raymond James. Yes, thank you. Good
      evening. The first question is just a little bit of help in interpreting the
      guidance. And if you could speak to the March quarter, perhaps in terms of seasonality
      and seasonal performance. And Luca, as you mentioned last year, because of the
      late launch, later launch of the phone, that some of that came into the March
      quarter and that was better than seasonal performance in March. Should we interpret
      because The supply constraints are easing somewhat as you go into the March
      quarter that we should see something similar that, you know, March quarter we''d
      get some better than seasonal performance. Is that the correct way to interpret
      your guidance? We talked about it on a year-over-year basis because that''s
      probably how most people look at it. And so just to recap what we said, first
      of all, we expect a record for the March quarter. We expect solid growth on
      a year-over-year basis. But as Tim was saying, we still expect significant supply
      constraints, but less than what we''ve seen in December. So I think on that
      basis, you can do the math around sequential. But given where we are in the
      environment, given the difficult compare, both on iPhone and as I mentioned
      in my prepared remarks, on services, we''re very, very happy with the way we''re
      guiding and the way the business is going right now. Thank you. As a follow-up,
      a follow-up question is on perhaps the sustainability and repeatability of the
      growth in iPhone after two very good years, well-received product and the 5G
      upgrade cycle. And I think there was a point in time when perhaps it was a view
      from some that iPhone was X growth, and that''s been proven wrong. Off of these
      very strong results, maybe you could speak to your level of confidence that
      iPhone continues to grow in the future and kind of what are the avenues for
      that growth? Yeah, Chris, it''s Tim. What I would say is that the iPhone has
      become an integral part of so many people''s lives now more than ever. And the
      active install base of iPhone continues to grow and is now at an all-time high.
      And during December, as we had mentioned, we had a record number of upgraders
      and grew switchers strong double digit, which I think speaks to the strength
      of the product. And that''s all in addition to an enormous customer satisfaction
      rating of 98% and are doing well throughout the geographies. And I''ve mentioned
      some of the geos that we track and how many units that we have on the top-selling
      model charts. And even though this is the second... second product announcement
      that has 5G in it, we''re still really in the early innings of 5G. I mean, if
      you look at the install base and look at how many people are on 5G versus not,
      and we don''t release those exact numbers, but you can do some math and estimate
      those. We maintain a very optimistic view on iPhone long-term. Thank you very
      much. Yes, thank you. Thanks. Can we have the next question, please? Thank you.
      I''ll take the next question from Ben Bolin with Cleveland Research. Thank you
      for taking the question. Tim, I''m interested in how you think about the relationship
      between the total IOS installed base and then the subsequent performance you
      see within the services or the paid subscriptions. And a second part to that
      is how do you look at the existing services business in terms of the growth
      you get from customers who are already subscribers versus completely net new
      or greenfield subscribers? I think I''ll let Luca comment on the second part
      of that. But if you back up and sort of look at how we''re doing, even though
      we have 785 million subs, relative to the total number of products offered and
      the customers it''s offered in, there''s still a lot of room to grow there.
      And so the way that I look at it is that there''s a lot more greenfield in front
      of us. And Ben, on the services engagement and how we think about customers,
      right? Obviously, it''s important for us that customers are engaged on our services
      platforms. and you know the ones that we have we know that the more engaged
      they are they''re more likely to stay with apple for the long term so we just
      obviously track all those metrics and they''re very important for us and and
      that''s why we continue to improve the quality of our offerings and the quantity
      over time as you''ve seen we''ve launched a lot of new services we obviously
      care a lot about new customers as well. That''s why we keep track of the install
      base and a lot of other metrics on that front. It''s very similar to what we
      do with products. I mean, also for products, we care a lot about upgraders.
      We care a lot about switchers. It''s obviously the combination of the two that
      when you put it together, provides the level of growth that you''ve actually
      seen in our services business. I mean, the last 12 months we''ve done over $72
      billion of revenue on services. It''s the size of a Fortune 50 company. It couldn''t
      happen without contribution from both existing and new customers. Thank you.
      Thanks. Can we have the next question, please? Thank you. We''ll take our next
      question from Harsh Kumar with Piper Sandler. Yeah. Hey, guys. First of all,
      congratulations on stellar quarter in December and all the records that the
      Apple community has set. Tim, I had a question on the content on Apple TV. When
      we look at the Apple content that you guys put out on TV, original content,
      it''s typically very socially responsible and healthy, for example, at Ted Lasso.
      Has this, in effect, created a constraint or a hesitancy of some sort for Apple
      to go and purchase studios when they come up? Or have those decisions been primarily
      financial or otherwise? We don''t make purely financial decisions about the
      content. We try to find great content that has a reason for being. And we love
      shows like Ted Lasso and several of the other shows as well that have a reason
      for existing and may have a good message and may make people feel better at
      the end of it. But I don''t view that we''ve narrowed our universe of things
      we''re selecting from. There''s plenty to pick from out there. And I think that
      we''re doing a pretty good job of it as we speak. Fair enough. And then my follow-up
      was the Apple vision of healthcare in the future. You guys have sort of cautiously
      approached healthcare with iWatch and iPhone. It''s mostly a preventative sort
      of approach. It provides you updates. But do you see a situation down the line
      where Apple perhaps plays a more active role, either through the watch or some
      other device where perhaps a doctor or a hospital mandates that the watch be
      worn effectively for critical and vital monitoring? And I was curious if you
      could just give us some color on how you guys think about healthcare and iWatch
      and that confluence. Well, with the Apple Watch, there''s literally not days
      that go by without me getting notes about someone that''s received a health
      alert. Maybe it''s to do with their cardiovascular health or more recently,
      a lot of people have told me that they fell and was knocked unconscious and
      couldn''t respond. And the watch responded for them to emergency contacts and
      emergency personnel. And so there''s a lot that we''re doing today. My sense
      has always been that there''s more here. I don''t want to get into a roadmap
      discussion in the call, but we continue to kind of pull the string and see where
      it takes us. But we''re really satisfied with how we''re doing in this area
      because we are fundamentally changing people''s lives and in some cases saving
      people''s lives. So it''s an area of great interest. Very helpful, Tim. Thank
      you. Thanks for the question. Thank you. A replay of today''s call will be available
      for two weeks on Apple Podcasts, as a webcast on apple.com slash investor, and
