      in a keynote fireside chat. Our earnings call to discuss the results of our
      third quarter of fiscal 2025 is scheduled for Wednesday, November 20th, 2024.
      With that, let me turn the call over to Collette. Thanks, Stuart. Q2 was another
      record quarter. Revenue of $30 billion was up 15% sequentially and up 122% year-on-year,
      and well above our outlook of $28 billion. Starting with data center. Data center
      revenue of $26.3 billion was a record, up 16% sequentially and up 154% year-on-year,
      driven by strong demand for NVIDIA Hopper GPU computing and our networking platforms.
      Compute revenue grew more than 2.5x. Networking revenue grew more than 2x from
      the last year. Cloud service providers represented roughly 45% of our data center
      revenue, and more than 50% stem from the consumer, internet, and enterprise
      companies. Customers continue to accelerate their Hopper architecture purchases
      while gearing up to adopt Blackwell. Key workloads driving our data center growth
      include generative AI, model training and inferencing, video, image, and text
      data, pre- and post-processing with CUDA and AI workloads, synthetic data generation,
      AI-powered recommender systems, SQL and vector database processing as well.
      Next generation models will require 10 to 20 times more compute to train with
      significantly more data. The trend is expected to continue. Over the trailing
      four quarters, we estimate that inference drove more than 40% of our data center
      revenue. CSPs, consumer internet companies, and enterprises benefit from the
      incredible throughput and efficiency of NVIDIA''s inference platform. Demand
      for NVIDIA is coming from frontier model makers, consumer internet services,
      and tens of thousands of companies and startups building generative AI applications
      for consumers, advertising, education, enterprise and healthcare, and robotics.
      desire NVIDIA''s rich ecosystem and availability in every cloud. CSPs appreciate
      the broad adoption of NVIDIA and are growing their NVIDIA capacity given the
      high demand. NVIDIA H200 platform began ramping in Q2, shipping to large CSPs,
      consumer internet and enterprise companies. The NVIDIA H200 builds upon the
      strength of our Hopper architecture and offering over 40% more memory bandwidth
      compared to the H100. Our data center revenue in China grew sequentially in
      Q2 and is a significant contributor to our data center revenue. As a percentage
      of total data center revenue, it remains below levels seen prior to the imposition
      of export controls. We continue to expect the China market to be very competitive
      going forward. The latest round of MLPerf inference benchmarks highlighted NVIDIA''s
      inference leadership with both NVIDIA, Hopper, and Blackwell platforms combining
      to win gold medals on all tasks. At Computex, NVIDIA with the top computer manufacturers
      unveiled an array of Blackwell architecture-powered systems and NVIDIA networking
      for building AI factories and data centers. With the NVIDIA MGX modular reference
      architecture, our OEMs and ODM partners are building more than 100 Blackwell-based
      systems designed quickly and cost-effectively. The NVIDIA Blackwell platform
      brings together multiple GPU, CPU, DPU, NVLink, NVLink Switch, and the networking
      chips, systems, and NVIDIA CUDA software to power the next generation of AI
      across the cases, industries, and countries. The NVIDIA GB200 NVL72 system with
      the fifth generation NVLink enables all 72 GPUs to act as a single GPU and deliver
      up to 30 times faster inference for LLMs, workloads, and unlocking the ability
      to run trillion parameter models in real time. Copper demand is strong and Blackwell
      is widely sampling. We executed a change to the Blackwell GPU mass to improve
      production yields. Blackwell production ramp is scheduled to begin in the fourth
      quarter and continue into fiscal year 26. In Q4, we expect to ship several billion
      dollars in Blackwell revenue. Hopper shipments are expected to increase in the
      second half of fiscal 2025. Hopper supply and availability have improved. Demand
      for Blackwell platforms is well above supply, and we expect this to continue
      into next year. Networking revenue increased 16% sequentially. Our Ethernet
      for AI revenue, which includes our SpectrumX end-to-end Ethernet platform, doubled
      sequentially with hundreds of customers adopting our Ethernet offerings. SpectrumX
      has broad market support from OEM and ODM partners and is being adopted by CSPs,
      GPU cloud providers, and enterprise, including XAI, to connect the largest GPU
      compute cluster in the world. SpectrumX supercharges Ethernet for AI processing
      and delivers 1.6x the performance of traditional Ethernet. We plan to launch
      new SpectrumX products every year to support demand for scaling compute clusters
      from tens of thousands of DPUs today to millions of DPUs in the near future.
      SpectrumX is well on track to begin a multi-billion dollar product line within
      a year. Our sovereign AI opportunities continue to expand as countries recognize
      AI expertise and infrastructure at national imperatives for their society and
      industries. Japan''s National Institute of Advanced Industrial Science and Technology
      is building its AI bridging cloud infrastructure 3.0 supercomputer with NVIDIA.
      We believe sovereign AI revenue will reach low double-digit billions this year.
      The enterprise AI wave has started. Enterprises also drove sequential revenue
      growth in the quarter. We are working with most of the Fortune 100 companies
      on AI initiatives across industries and geographies. A range of applications
      are fueling our growth, including AI-powered chatbots, generative AI co-pilots,
      and agents to build new monetizable business applications and enhance employee
      productivity. Amdocs is using NVIDIA generative AI for their smart agent, transforming
      the customer experience and reducing customer service costs by 30%. ServiceNow
      is using NVIDIA for its Now Assist offering, the fastest growing new product
      in the company''s history. SAP is using NVIDIA to build dual co-pilots. Cohesity
      is using NVIDIA to build their generative AI agent and lower generative AI development
      costs. Snowflake, who serves over 3 billion queries a day for over 10,000 enterprise
      customers, is working with NVIDIA to build co-pilots. And lastly, Wistron is
      using NVIDIA AI Omniverse to reduce end-to-end cycle times for their factories
      by 50%. Automotive was a key growth driver for the quarter, as every automaker
      developing autonomous vehicle technology is using NVIDIA in their data centers.
      Automotive will drive multi-billion dollars in revenue across on-prem and cloud
      consumption and will grow as next generation AV models require significantly
      more compute. Healthcare is also on its way to being a multi-billion dollar
      business as AI revolutionizes medical imaging, surgical robots, patient care,
      electronic health, record processing, and drug discovery. During the quarter,
      we announced a new NVIDIA AI Foundry service to supercharge generative AI for
      the world''s enterprises with Meta''s LAMA 3.1 collection of models. This marks
      a watershed moment for enterprise AI. Companies for the first time can leverage
      the capabilities of an open source frontier level model to develop customized
      AI applications to encode their institutional knowledge into an AI flywheel
      to automate and accelerate their business. Accenture is the first to adopt the
      new service to build custom LAMA 3.1 models for both its own use and to assist
      clients seeking to deploy generative AI applications. NVIDIA NIMS accelerate
      and simplify model deployment. Companies across healthcare, energy, financial
      services, retail, transportation, and telecommunications are adopting NIMS,
      including Aramco, Lowe''s, and Uber. AT&T realized 70% cost savings and eight
      times latency reduction after moving into NIMS for generative AI, call transcription,
      and classification. Over 150 partners are embedding NIMS across every layer
      of the AI ecosystem. We announced NIM agent blueprints, a catalog of customizable
      reference applications that include a full suite of software for building and
      deploying enterprise generative AI applications. With NIM agent blueprints,
      enterprises can refine their AI applications over time, creating a data-driven
      AI flywheel. The first NIM agent blueprints include workloads for customer service,
      computer-aided drug discovery, and enterprise retrieval augmented generation.
      Our system integrators, technology solution providers, and system builders are
      bringing NVIDIA NIM agent blueprints to enterprises. NVIDIA NIM and NIM agent
      blueprints are available through the NVIDIA AI enterprise software platform,
      which has great momentum. We expect our software SaaS, and support revenue to
      approach a $2 billion annual run rate exiting this year, with NVIDIA AI Enterprise
      notably contributing to growth. Moving to gaming and AI PCs. Gaming revenue
      of $2.88 billion increased 9% sequentially and 16% year on year. We saw sequential
      growth in console, notebook, and desktop revenue, and demand is strong and growing,
      and channel inventory remains healthy. Every PC with RTX is an AI PC. RTX PCs
      can deliver up to 1,300 AI tops, and there are now over 200 RTX AI laptops designed
      from leading PC manufacturers. With 600 AI-powered applications and games and
      an installed base of 100 million devices, RTX is set to revolutionize consumer
      experiences with generative AI. NVIDIA ACE, a suite of generative AI technologies,
      is available for RTX AI PCs. Mega Break is the first game to use NVIDIA ACE,
      including our small language model, Minitron 4B, optimized on device inference.
      The NVIDIA gaming ecosystem continues to grow. Recently added RTX and DLSS titles,
      including Indiana Jones and The Great Circle, Dune Awakening, and Dragon Age,
      The Veil Guard. The GeForce Now library continues to expand with total catalog
      size of over 2,000 titles, the most content of any cloud gaming service. moving
      to pro-visualization. Revenue of $454 million was up 6% sequentially and 20%
      year-on-year. Demand is being driven by AI and graphic use cases, including
      model fine tuning and Omniverse-related workloads. Automotive and manufacturing
      were among the key industry verticals driving growth this quarter. Companies
      are racing to digitalize workflows to drive efficiency across their operations.
      The world''s largest electronics manufacturer, Foxconn, is using NVIDIA Omniverse
      to power digital twins of the physical plants that produce NVIDIA black hole
      systems. And several large global enterprises, including Mercedes-Benz, signed
      multi-year contracts for NVIDIA Omniverse Cloud to build industrial digital
      twins of factories. We announced new NVIDIA USD NIMs and connectors to open
      Omniverse to new industries and enable developers to incorporate generative
      AI co-pilots and agents into USD workloads, accelerating their ability to build
      highly accurate virtual worlds. WPP is implementing USD NIM microservices in
      its generative AI-enabled content creation pipeline for customers. such as the
      Coca-Cola Company. Moving to automotive and robotics, revenue was $346 million,
      up 5% sequentially and up 37% year-on-year. Year-on-year growth was driven by
      the new customer ramps in self-driving platforms and increased demand for AI
      cockpit solutions. At the Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition Conference,
      NVIDIA won the Autonomous Grand Challenge in the end-to-end driving at scale
      category, outperforming more than 400 entries worldwide. Austin Dynamics, BYD
      Electronics, Figure Intrinsic, Siemens, Skills 8i, and Teradyne Robotics are
      using the NVIDIA ISAAC Robotics platform for autonomous robot arms, humanoids,
      and mobile robots. Now, moving to the rest of the P&L. Gap gross margins were
      75.1%, and non-gap gross margins were 75.7%. Down sequentially due to a higher
      mix of new products within data center and inventory provisions for low-yielding
      blackwell material. Sequentially, gap and non-gap operating expenses were up
      12%, primarily reflecting higher compensation-related costs. Cash flow from
      operations was $14.5 billion. In Q2, we utilized cash of $7.4 billion towards
      shareholder returns in the form of share repurchases and cash dividends, reflecting
      the increase in dividend per share. Our board of directors recently approved
      a $50 billion share repurchase authorization to add to our remaining $7.5 billion
      of authorization at the end of Q2. Let me turn the outlook for the third quarter.
      Total revenue is expected to be 32.5 billion plus or minus 2%. Our third quarter
      revenue outlook incorporates continued growth of our hopper architecture and
      sampling of our Blackwell products. We expect Blackwell production ramp in Q4.
      Gap and non-gap gross margins are expected to be 74.4% and 75% respectively.
      plus or minus 50 basis points. As our data center mix continues the shift to
      new products, we expect this trend to continue into the fourth quarter fiscal
      2025. For the full year, we expect gross margins to be in the mid-70% range.
      GAAP and non-GAAP operating expenses are expected to be approximately 4.3 billion
      and 3.0 billion, respectively. Full-year operating expenses are expected to
      grow in the mid to upper 40% range as we work on developing our next generation
      of products. GAAP and non-GAAP other income and expenses are expected to be
      about $350 million, including gains and losses from non-affiliated investments
      and publicly held equity securities. GAAP and non-GAAP tax rates are expected
      to be 17%, plus or minus 1%, excluding any discrete items. Further financial
      details are included in the CFO commentary and other information available on
      our IR website. We are now going to open the call for questions. Operator, would
      you please help us and poll for questions? Thank you. And at this time, I would
      like to remind everyone in order to ask a question, press star and then the
      number one on your telephone keypad. We will pause for just a moment to compile
      the Q&A roster. And as a reminder, we ask that you please limit yourself to
      one question. And your first question comes from the line of Vivek Arya with
      Bank of America Securities. Your line is open. Thanks for taking my question.
      Jensen, you mentioned in the prepared comments that there''s a change in the
      Blackwell GPU mask I''m curious, are there any other incremental changes in
      back-end packaging or anything else? And I think related, you suggested that
      you could ship several billion dollars of Blackwell in Q4 despite a change in
      the design. Is it because all these issues will be solved by then? Just help
      us size what is the overall impact of any changes in Blackwell timing, what
      that means to your kind of revenue profile, and how are customers reacting to
      it? Yeah, thanks, Vivek. The change to the mask is complete. There were no functional
      changes necessary. And so we''re sampling functional samples of Blackwell, Grace
      Blackwell, in a variety of system configurations as we speak. There are something
      like 100 different types of Blackwell-based systems that are built that were
      shown at Computext. and we''re enabling our ecosystem to start sampling those.
      The functionality of Blackwell is as it is, and we expect to start production
      in Q4. And your next question comes from the line of Toshi Ahari with Goldman
      Sachs. Your line is open. Hi, thank you so much for taking the question. Jensen,
      I had a relatively longer-term question. As you may know, there''s a pretty
      heated debate in the market on your customers and customers'' customers'' return
      on investment and what that means for the sustainability of CapEx going forward.
      Internally at NVIDIA, what are you guys watching? What''s on your dashboard
      as you try to gauge customer return and and how that impacts CapEx. And then
      a quick follow-up maybe for Colette. I think your sovereign AI number for the
      full year went up maybe a couple billion. What''s driving the improved outlook,
      and how should we think about fiscal 26? Thank you. Thanks, Satoshi. First of
      all, when I said ship production in Q4, I mean shipping out. I don''t mean starting
      to ship, but I mean, I don''t mean starting production, but shipping out. On
      the longer-term question, let''s take a step back And you''ve heard me say that
      we''re going through two simultaneous platform transitions at the same time.
      The first one is transitioning from accelerated computing to, from general purpose
      computing to accelerated computing. And the reason for that is because CPU scaling
      has been known to be slowing for some time. And it is slow to a crawl. And yet
      the amount of computing demand continues to grow quite significantly. You could
      maybe even estimate it to be doubling every single year. And so if we don''t
      have a new approach, computing inflation would be driving up the cost for every
      company, and it would be driving up the energy consumption of data centers around
      the world. In fact, you''re seeing that. And so the answer is accelerated computing.
      We know that accelerated computing, of course, speeds up applications. It also
      enables you to do computing at a much larger scale, for example, scientific
      simulations or database processing. But what that translates directly to is
      lower cost and lower energy consumed. And in fact, this week, there''s a blog
      that came out that talked about a whole bunch of new libraries that we offer.
      And that''s really the core of the first platform transition, going from general
      purpose computing to accelerated computing. And it''s not unusual to see someone
      save 90% of their computing cost. And the reason for that is, of course, you
      just sped up an application 50x. You would expect the computing cost to decline
      quite significantly. The second was enabled by accelerated computing because
      we drove down the cost of training large language models or training deep learning
      so incredibly that it is now possible to have gigantic scale models, multi-trillion
      parameter models, and pre-train it on just about the world''s knowledge corpus
      and let the model go figure out how to understand human language representation
      and how to codify knowledge into its neural networks and how to learn reasoning.
      And so which caused the generative AI revolution? Now, generative AI, taking
      a step back about why it is that we went so deeply into it, is because it''s
      not just a feature. It''s not just a capability. It''s a fundamental new way
      of doing software. Instead of human engineered algorithms, we now have data.
      We tell the AI, we tell the model, we tell the computer, what are the expected
      answers? What are our previous observations? And then for it to figure out what
      the algorithm is, what''s the function, it learns a universal, you know, AI
      is a bit of a universal function approximator, and it learns the function. And
      so you could learn the function of almost anything. And anything that you have
      that''s predictable, anything that has structure, anything that you have previous
      examples of. And so now here we are with generative AI. It''s a fundamental
      new form of computer science. It''s affecting how every layer of computing is
      done from CPU to GPU, from human-engineered algorithms to machine-learned algorithms,
      and the type of applications you could now develop and produce is fundamentally
      remarkable. And there are several things that are happening in generative AI.
      So the first thing that''s happening is the frontier models are growing in quite
      substantial scale. And they''re still seeing, we''re still all seeing the benefits
      of scaling. And whenever you double the size of a model, you also have to more
      than double the size of the data set to go train it. And so the amount of flops
      necessary in order to create that model goes up quadratically. And so it''s
      not unexpected to see that the next generation models could take 20, 10, 20,
      40 times more compute than last generation. So we have to continue to drive
      the generational performance up quite significantly so we can drive down the
      energy consumed and drive down the cost necessary to do it. So the first one
      is, There are larger frontier models trained on more modalities, and surprisingly,
      there are more frontier model makers than last year. And so you have more on
      more on more. That''s one of the dynamics going on in generative AI. The second
      is, although it''s below the tip of the iceberg, what we see are chat GPT, image
      generators, We see coding. We use generative AI for coding quite extensively
      here at NVIDIA now. We, of course, have a lot of digital designers and things
      like that. But those are kind of the tip of the iceberg. What''s below the iceberg
      are the largest systems, largest computing systems in the world today, which
      are, and you''ve heard me talk about this in the past, which are recommender
      systems moving from CPUs. It''s now moving from CPUs to generative AI. So recommender
      systems, ad generation, custom ad generation, targeting ads at very large scale
      and quite hyper-targeting, search, and user-generated content. These are all
      very large-scale applications have now evolved to generative AI. Of course,
      the number of generative AI startups is generating tens of billions of dollars
      of cloud renting opportunities for our cloud partners. And sovereign AI, countries
      that are now realizing that their data is their natural and national resource,
      and they have to use AI, build their own AI infrastructure so that they could
      have their own digital intelligence. Enterprise AI, as Colette mentioned earlier,
      is starting. And you might have seen our announcement that the world''s leading
      IT company companies are joining us to take the NVIDIA AI Enterprise platform
      to the world''s enterprises. The companies that we''re talking to, so many of
      them are just so incredibly excited to drive more productivity out of their
      company. And then general robotics, the big transformation last year as we are
      able to now learn physical AI from watching video and human demonstration and
      synthetic data generation from reinforcement learning from systems like Omniverse.
      We are now able to work with just about every robotics companies now to start
      thinking about start building general robotics. And so you can see that there
      are just so many different directions that generative AI is going. And so we''re
      actually seeing the momentum of generative AI accelerating. And Tashia, to answer
      your question regarding sovereign AI and our goals in terms of growth, in terms
      of revenue, it certainly is a unique and growing opportunity, something that
      surfaced with generative AI and the desires of countries around the world to
      have their own that would be able to incorporate their own language, incorporate
      their own culture, incorporate their own data in that country. So more and more
      excitement around these models and what they can be specific for those countries.
      So yes, we are seeing some growth opportunity in front of us. And your next
      question comes from the line of Joe Moore with Morgan Stanley. Your line is
      open. Great, thank you. Vincent, in the press release, you talked about Blackwell
      anticipation being incredible, but it seems like Hopper demand is also really
      strong. I mean, you''re guiding for a very strong quarter without Blackwell
      in October. So, you know, how long do you see sort of coexisting strong demand
      for both? And can you talk about the transition to Blackwell? Do you see people
      intermixing clusters? Do you think most of the Blackwell activities, new clusters,
      just some sense of what that transition looks like? Yeah, thanks, Joe. The demand
      for Hopper is really strong. And it''s true, the demand for Blackwell is incredible.
      There''s a couple of reasons for that. The first reason is if you just look
      at the world''s cloud service providers and the amount of GPU capacity they
      have available, it''s basically none. And the reason for that is because they''re
      either being deployed internally for accelerating their own workloads, data
      processing, for example. Data processing, you know, we hardly ever talk about
      it because it''s mundane. You know, it''s not very cool because it doesn''t
      generate a picture or, you know, generate words. But almost every single company
      in the world processes data in the background. And NVIDIA''s GPUs are the only
      accelerators on the planet that process and accelerate data. SQL data, Pandas
      data, data science, toolkits like Pandas and the new one, Polars. These are
      the most popular data processing platforms in the world. And aside from CPUs,
      which, as I''ve mentioned before, really running out of steam, NVIDIA''s accelerated
      computing is really the only way to get boosting performance out of that. And
      so that''s number one, is the primary, the number one use case long before generative
      AI came along is the migration of applications one after another. to accelerated
      computing. The second is, of course, the rentals. They''re renting capacity
      to model makers. They''re renting it to startup companies. And a generative
      AI company spends the vast majority of their invested capital into infrastructure
      so that they could use an AI to help them create products. And so these companies
      need it now. They just simply can''t afford, you know, you just raised money.
      They want you to put it to use now. You have processing that you have to do.
      You can''t do it next year. You got to do it today. And so there''s a fair,
      that''s one reason. The second reason for hopper demand right now is because
      of the race to the next plateau. The first person to the next plateau gets to
      be, you know, gets to introduce a revolutionary level of AI. The second person
      who gets there is incrementally, you know, better or about the same. And so
      the ability to systematically and consistently race to the next plateau and
      be the first one there is how you establish leadership. You know, NVIDIA is
      constantly doing that, and we show that to the world in the GPUs we make and
      the AI factories that we make. the networking systems that we make, the SOCs
      we create. I mean, we want to set the pace. We want to be consistently the world''s
      best. And that''s the reason why we drive ourselves so hard. Of course, we also
      want to see our dreams come true and all of the capabilities that we imagine
      in the future and the benefits that we can bring to society. We want to see
      all that come true. And so... These model makers are the same. Of course, they
      want to be the world''s best. They want to be the world''s first. And although
      Blackwell will start shipping out in billions of dollars at the end of this
      year, the standing up of the capacity is still probably weeks and a month or
      so away. And so between now and then is a lot of generative AI market dynamic.
      And so Everybody is just really in a hurry. It''s either operational reasons
      that they need it. They need accelerated computing. They don''t want to build
      any more general purpose computing infrastructure. And even Hopper, you know,
      of course, H200 is state of the art. Hopper, if you have a choice between building
      CPU infrastructure right now for business or Hopper infrastructure for business
      right now, that decision is relatively clear. And so I think people are just
      clamoring to transition the trillion dollars of established installed infrastructure
      to a modern infrastructure in Hopper''s state of the art. And your next question
      comes from the line of Matt Ramsey with TD Cowan. Your line is open. Thank you
      very much. Good afternoon, everybody. wanted to kind of circle back to an earlier
      question about the debate that investors are having about the ROI on all of
      this capex. And hopefully this question and the distinction will make some some
      sense. But what I''m what I''m having discussions about is with like the percentage
      of folks that you see that are spending all this money and looking to sort of
      push the frontier towards AGI convergence, and as you just said, a new plateau
      in capability. And they''re going to spend regardless to get to that level of
      capability because it opens up so many doors for the industry and for their
      company versus customers that are really, really focused today on CapEx versus
      ROI. I don''t know if that distinction makes sense. I''m just trying to get
      a sense of how you''re seeing the priorities of people that are putting the
      dollars in the ground on this new technology and what their priorities are and
      their timeframes are for that investment. Thanks. Thanks, Matt. The people who
      are investing in NVIDIA infrastructure are getting returns on it right away.
      It''s the best ROI infrastructure, computing infrastructure investment you can
      make today. And so, So one way to think through it, probably the easiest way
      to think through it is just go back to first principles. You have a trillion
      dollars worth of general purpose computing infrastructure. And the question
      is, do you want to build more of that or not? And for every billion dollars
      worth of general CPU based infrastructure that you stand up, you probably rent
      it for less than a billion. And so because it''s commoditized, there''s already
      a trillion dollars on the ground. What''s the point of getting more? And so
      the people who are clamoring to get this infrastructure, one, when they build
      out Hopper-based infrastructure and soon Blackwell-based infrastructure, they
      start saving money. That''s tremendous return on investment. And the reason
      why they start saving money is because data processing saves money. Data processing
      is probably just a giant part of it already. And so recommender systems save
      money. so on and so forth. And so you start saving money. The second thing is
      everything you stand up are going to get rented because so many companies are
      being founded to create generative AI. And so your capacity gets rented right
      away. And the return on investment of that is really good. And then the third
      reason is your own business. You want to either create the next frontier yourself
      or your own internet services benefit from a next-generation ad system or a
      next-generation recommender system or a next-generation search system. So for
      your own services, for your own stores, for your own user-generated content,
      social media platforms, for your own services, generative AI is also a fast
      ROI. And so there''s a lot of ways you could think through it, but at the core,
      it''s because It is the best computing infrastructure you could put in the ground
      today. The world of general purpose computing is shifting to accelerated computing.
      The world of human engineered software is moving to generative AI software.
      If you were to build infrastructure to modernize your cloud and your data centers,
      build it with accelerated computing and NVIDIA. That''s the best way to do it.
      And your next question comes from the line of Timothy Arcuri with UBS. Your
      line is open. Thanks a lot. I had a question on the shape of the revenue growth,
      both near and longer term. I know, Colette, you did increase OPEX for the year.
      And if I look at the increase in your purchase commitments and your supply obligations,
      that''s also quite bullish. On the other hand, there''s some school of thought
      that not that many customers really seem ready for liquid cooling. And I do
      recognize that some of these racks can be air cooled. But, Jensen, is that something
      to consider sort of on the shape of how Blackwell is going to ramp? And then
      I guess when you look beyond next year, which is obviously going to be a great
      year, and you look into 26, do you worry about any other gating factors like,
      say, the power supply chain or at some point models start to get smaller? I''m
      just wondering if you can speak to that. Thanks. I''m going to work backwards.
      I really appreciate the question, Tim. So remember, the world is moving from
      general purpose computing to accelerated computing. And the world builds about
      a trillion dollars worth of data centers. You know, a trillion dollars worth
      of data centers in a few years will be all accelerated computing. In the past,
      no GPUs are in data centers, just CPUs. In the future, every single data center
      will have GPUs. And the reason for that is very clear because we need to accelerate
      workloads so that we can continue to be sustainable, continue to drive down
      the cost of computing so that when we do more computing, we don''t experience
      computing inflation. Second, we need GPUs for a new computing model called generative
      AI that we can all acknowledge is going to be quite transformative to the future
      of computing. And so I think working backwards, the way to think about that
      is the next trillion dollars of the world''s infrastructure will clearly be
      different than the last trillion, and it will be vastly accelerated. With respect
      to the shape of our ramp, we offer multiple configurations of Blackwell. Blackwell
      comes in either a Blackwell classic, if you will, that uses the HGX form factor
      that we pioneered with Volta. And I think it was Volta. And so we''ve been shipping
      the HGX form factor for some time. It is air cooled. The Grace Blackwell is
      liquid cooled. However, the number of data centers that want to go liquid cooled
      is quite significant. And the reason for that is because we can, in a liquid
      cooled data center, In any data center, power limited data center, whatever
      size data center you choose, you could install and deploy anywhere from three
      to five times the AI throughput compared to the past. And so liquid cooling
      is cheaper. Liquid cooling, our TCO is better. And liquid cooling allows you
      to have the benefit of this capability we call MVLink, which allows us to expand
      it to 72 Grace Blackwell packages, which has essentially 144 GPUs. And so imagine
      144 GPUs connected in MVLink, and we''re increasingly showing you the benefits
      of that. And the next click is obviously very low latency, very high throughput,
      large language model inference. The large MVLink domain is going to be a game
      changer for that. And so I think people are very comfortable deploying both.
      And so almost every CSP we''re working with are deploying some of both. And
      so I''m pretty confident that we''ll ramp it up just fine. Your second question
      out of the third is looking forward, yeah, next year is going to be a great
      year. We expect to grow our data center business quite significantly next year.
      Blackwell is going to be a complete game changer for the industry. And Blackwell
      is going to carry into the following year. And as I mentioned earlier, working
      backwards from first principles, remember that computing is going through two
      platform transitions at the same time. And that''s just really, really important
      to keep your mind focused on, which is general purpose computing is shifting
      to accelerated computing and human engineered software is going to transition
      to generative ai or artificial intelligence learned software okay and your next
      question comes from the line of stacy raskin with bernstein research your line
      is open hi guys thanks for taking my questions i have two short questions for
      colette The first, several billion dollars of Blackwell revenue in Q4, is that
      additive? You said you expected Hopper demand to strengthen in the second half.
      Does that mean Hopper strengthens Q3 to Q4 as well on top of Blackwell adding
      several billion dollars? And the second question on gross margins, if I have
      mid-70s for the year, depending where I want to draw that, if I have 75 for
      the year, I''d be something like 71 to 72. for Q4 somewhere in that range? Is
      that the kind of exit rate for gross margins that you''re expecting? And how
      should we think about the drivers of gross margin evolution in the next year
      as Blackwell ramps and, I mean, hopefully, I guess the yields and the inventory
      reserves and everything come up? This is Stacy. Let''s first take your question
      that you had about Hopper and Blackwell. So we believe our Hopper will continue
      to grow into the second half. We have many new products for Hopper, our existing
      products for Hopper, that we believe will start continuing to ramp in the next
      quarters, including our Q3 and those new products moving to Q4. So let''s say
      Hopper, therefore, versus H1 is a growth opportunity for that. Additionally,
      we have the Blackwell on top of that. and the Blackwell starting of ramping
      in Q4. So, hope that helps you on those two pieces. Your second piece is in
      terms of on our gross margin. We provided gross margin for our Q3. We provided
      our gross margin on a non-GAAP at about 75. We''ll work with all the different
      transitions that we''re going through, but we do believe we can do that 75 in
      Q3. We provided that we''re still on track for the full year, also in the mid-70s
      or approximately the 75. So we''re going to see some slight difference possibly
      in Q4, again, with our transitions and the different cost structures that we
      have on our new product introductions. However, I''m not in the same number
      that you are there. We don''t have exactly guidance, but I do believe you''re
      lower than where we are. And your next question comes from the line of Ben Reitzes
      with Mellius. Your line is open. Yeah. Hey, thanks a lot for the question, Jensen
      and Colette. I wanted to ask about the geographies. There was the 10Q that came
      out and the United States was down sequentially while several Asian geographies
      were up a lot sequentially. Just wondering what the dynamics are there and Um,
      obviously China did very well. You mentioned it, your remarks, what are the
      puts and takes? And then I just wanted to clarify from Stacy''s question, um,
      if that means, uh, the sequential overall revenue growth rates for the company
      accelerate in the fourth quarter, given all those favorable revenue dynamics.
      Thanks. Let me talk about, um, a bit in terms of our disclosure, in terms of
      the time queue, a required disclosure and a choice of geographies. Very challenging
      sometimes to create that right disclosure as we have to come up with one key
      piece. Pieces in terms of we have in terms of who we sell to and or specifically
      who we invoice to. And so what you''re seeing in terms of there is who we invoice.
      That''s not necessarily where the product will eventually be and where it may
      even travel to the end customer. These are just moving to our OEMs, our ODMs,
      and our system integrators for the most part across our product portfolio. So
      what you''re seeing there is sometimes just a swift shift in terms of who they
      are using to complete their full configuration before those things are going
      into the data center, going into notebooks and those pieces of it. And that
      shift happens from time to time. But yes, our China number there, our inverse
      into China, keep in mind that is incorporating both gaming, also data center,
      also automotive in those numbers that we have. Going back to your statement
      regarding gross margin and also what we''re seeing in terms of what we''re looking
      at for Hopper and Blackwell in terms of revenue. Hopper will continue to grow
      in the second half, will continue to grow from what we are currently seeing.
      During determining that exact mix In each Q3 and Q4, we don''t have here. We
      are not here to guide yet in terms of Q4. But we do see right now the demand
      expectations. We do see the visibility that that will be a growth opportunity
      in Q4. On top of that, we will have our Blackwell architecture. And your next
      question comes from the line of CJ Muse with Cantor Fitzgerald. Your line is
      open. Yeah, good afternoon. Thank you for taking the question. You''ve embarked
      on a remarkable annual product cadence with challenges only likely becoming
      more and more given, you know, rising complexity and a radical limit in the
      advanced package world. So curious, you know, if you take a step back, how does
      this backdrop alter your thinking around potentially greater vertical integration,
      supply chain partnerships, and then thinking through consequential impact to
      your margin profile? Thank you. Yeah, thanks. Thanks. Let''s see. I think the
      answer to your first question is that the reason why our velocity is so high
      is simultaneously because the complexity of the model is growing, and we want
      to continue to drive its cost down. It''s growing, so we want to continue to
      increase its scale. And we believe that by continuing to scale the AI models,
      that will reach a level of extraordinary usefulness and that it would open up,
      realize the next industrial revolution. We believe it. And so we''re going to
      drive ourselves really hard to continue to go up that scale. We have the ability,
      fairly uniquely, to integrate to design an AI factory because we have all the
      parts. It''s not possible to come up with a new AI factory every year unless
      you have all the parts. And so next year, we''re going to ship a lot more CPUs
      than we''ve ever had in the history of our company, more GPUs, of course, but
      also NVLink switches, CX, DPUs, ConnectX DPU for East and West, Bluefield DPUs
      for North and South and data and storage processing, to InfiniBand for supercomputing
      centers, to Ethernet, which is a brand new product for us, which is well on
      its way to becoming a multi-billion dollar business to bring AI to Ethernet.
      The fact that we could build, we have access to all of this. We have one architectural
      stack, as you know. It allows us to introduce new capabilities to the market
      as we complete it. Otherwise, what happens, you ship these parts, you go find
      customers to sell it to, and then you''ve got to build, somebody''s got to build
      up an AI factory. And the AI factory has got a mountain of software. And so
      it''s not about who integrates it. We love the fact that our supply chain is
      disintegrated in the sense that we could service, you know, Quanta, Foxconn,
      HP, Dell, Lenovo, Supermicro. We used to be able to service ZT. They were recently
      purchased and so on and so forth. And so the number of ecosystem partners that
      we have Gigabyte, ASUS, the number of ecosystem partners that we have that allows
      them to take our architecture, which all works, but integrate it in a bespoke
      way into all of the world''s cloud service providers, enterprise data centers.
      The scale and reach necessary from our ODMs and our integrator supply chain
      is vast and gigantic because the world is huge. And so that part we don''t want
      to do and we''re not good at doing. But we know how to design the AI infrastructure,
      provide it the way that customers would like it, and let the ecosystem integrate
      it. Well, yeah. So anyways, that''s the reason why. And your final question
      comes from the line of Aaron Rakers with Wells Fargo. Your line is open. Yes,
      thanks for taking the question. I wanted to go back into the Blackwell product
      cycle. One of the questions that we tend to get asked is how you see the rack
      scale system mix dynamic as you think about leveraging NVLink. You think about
      GB, you know, NVL72. And how that go-to-market dynamic looks as far as the Blackwell
      product cycle. I guess I put distinctly, how do you see that mix of rack scale
      systems as we start to think about the Blackwell cycle playing out? Yeah, Aaron,
      thanks. The Blackwell rack system, it''s designed and architected as a rack,
      but it''s sold in disaggregated system components. We don''t sell the whole
      rack. And the reason for that is because everybody''s rack''s a little different,
      surprisingly. Some of them are OCP standards, some of them are not. Some of
      them are enterprise. And the power limits for everybody could be a little different.
      Choice of CDUs, the choice of power bus bars, the configuration and integration
      into people''s data centers, all different. So the way we designed it, we architected
      the whole rack. The software is going to work perfectly across the whole rack.
      And then we provide the system components. Like, for example, the CPU and GPU
      compute board is then integrated into an MGX. It''s a modular system architecture.
      MGX is completely ingenious. And we have MGX ODMs and integrators and OEMs all
      over the plant. And so just about any configuration you would like, where you
      would like that 3,000-pound rack to be delivered, it has to be integrated and
      assembled close to the data center because it''s fairly heavy. And so everything
      from the supply chain, from the moment that we ship the GPU CPUs the switches,
      the NICs. From that point forward, the integration is done quite close to the
      location of the CSPs and the locations of the data centers. And so you can imagine
      how many data centers in the world there are and how many logistics hubs we''ve
      scaled out to with our ODM partners. And so I think because we show it as one
      rack and because it''s always rendered that way, and shown that way, we might
      have left the impression that we''re doing the integration. Our customers hate
      that we do integration. The supply chain hates us doing integration. They want
      to do the integration. That''s their value added. There''s a final design in,
      if you will. It''s not quite as simple as shimmy into a data center, but that
      design fit in is really complicated. And so the design fit in, the installation,
      the bring up, the repair and replace, that entire cycle is done all over the
      world. And we have a sprawling network of ODM and OEM partners that does this
      incredibly well. So integration is not the reason why we''re doing this. racks,
      it''s the anti-reason of doing it. We don''t want to be an integrator. We want
      to be a technology provider. And I will now turn the call back over to Jensen
      Huang for closing remarks. Thank you. Let me make a couple of comments that
      I made earlier again. The data center worldwide are in full steam to modernize
      the entire computing stack with accelerated computing and generative AI. Hopper
      demand remains strong, and the anticipation for Blackwell is incredible. Let
      me highlight the top five things, the top five things of our company. Accelerated
      computing has reached a tipping point. CPU scaling slows. Developers must accelerate
      everything possible. Accelerated computing starts with CUDAx libraries. New
      libraries open new markets for NVIDIA. We released many new libraries, including
      CUDAx accelerated pollers, Pandas, and Spark, the leading data science and data
      processing libraries. QVS for vector databases. This is incredibly hot right
      now. Ariel and Shiona for 5G wireless base station. A whole suite of a whole
      world of data centers that we can go into now. Parabricks for gene sequencing.
      And AlphaFold2 for protein structure prediction is now CUDA accelerated. We
      are at the beginning of our journey to modernize a trillion dollars worth of
      data centers from general purpose computing to accelerated computing. That''s
      number one. Number two, Blackwell is a step function leap over Hopper. Blackwell
      is an AI infrastructure platform, not just a GPU. Also happens to be the name
      of our GPU, but it''s an AI infrastructure platform. As we reveal more of Blackwell
      and sample systems to our partners and customers, the extent of Blackwell''s
      leap becomes clear. The Blackwell vision took nearly five years and seven one-of-a-kind
      chips to realize. The gray CPU, the Blackwell dual GPU in a co-op package, ConnectX
      DPU for east-west traffic, Bluefield DPU for north-south and storage traffic,
      MV-Link switch for all-to-all GPU communications, and Quantum and Spectrum X
      for both InfiniBand and Ethernet, can support the massive burst traffic of AI.
      Blackwell AI factories are building-sized computers. NVIDIA designed and optimized
      the Blackwell platform full-stack, end-to-end, from chips, systems, networking,
      even structured cables, power and cooling, and mountains of software to make
      it fast for customers to build AI factories. These are very capital-intensive
      infrastructures customers want to deploy it as soon as they get their hands
      on the equipment and deliver the best performance and TCO. Blackwell provides
      three to five times more AI throughput in a power-limited data center than Hopper.
      The third is MVLink. This is a very big deal. Its all-to-all GPU switch is game-changing.
      The Blackwell system lets us connect 144 GPUs in 72... GB200 packages into one
      MVLink domain with an aggregate MVLink bandwidth of 259 terabytes per second
      in one rack. Just put that in perspective, that''s about 10 times higher than
      Hopper. 259 terabytes per second kind of makes sense because you need to boost
      the training of multi-trillion parameter models on trillions of tokens. And
      so that natural amount of data needs to be moved around from GPU to GPU. For
      inference, MVLink is vital for low latency, high throughput, large language
      model, token generation. We now have three networking platforms. MVLink for
      GPU scale up, Quantum InfiniBand for supercomputing and dedicated AI factories,
      and SpectrumX for AI on Ethernet. MVLink''s networking footprint is much bigger
      than before. Generative AI momentum is accelerating. Generative AI frontier
      model makers are racing to scale to the next AI plateau to increase model safety
      and IQ. We''re also scaling to understand more modalities from text, images,
      and video to 3D, physics, chemistry, and biology. Chatbots, coding AIs, and
      image generators are growing fast, but it''s just the tip of the iceberg. Internet
      services are deploying generative AI for large-scale recommenders, ad targeting,
      and search systems. AI startups are consuming tens of billions of dollars yearly
      of CSP''s cloud capacity, and countries are recognizing the importance of AI
      and investing in sovereign AI infrastructure. And NVIDIA Omniverse is opening
      up the next era of AI, general robotics. And now the enterprise AI wave has
      started, and we''re poised to help companies transform their businesses. The
      NVIDIA AI Enterprise Platform consists of NEMO, NEMS, NEM Agent Blueprints,
      and AI Foundry that our ecosystem partners, the world-leading IT companies,
      use to help companies customize AI models and build bespoke AI applications.
      Enterprises can then deploy on NVIDIA AI Enterprise runtime. And at $4,500 per
      GPU per year, NVIDIA AI Enterprise is an exceptional value for deploying AI
      anywhere. And for NVIDIA''s software TAM can be significant as the CUDA-compatible
      GPU install base grows from millions to tens of millions. And as Colette mentioned,
      NVIDIA software will exit the year at a $2 billion run rate. Thank you all for
      joining us today. And ladies and gentlemen, this concludes today''s call, and
      we thank you for your participation. You may now disconnect.", "questions_and_answers":
