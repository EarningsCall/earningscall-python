    body: '{"text": "Greetings, and welcome to the Microsoft Fiscal Year 2023 First
      Quarter Earnings Conference Call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only
      mode. A question and answer session will follow the formal presentation. If
      anyone should require operator assistance during the conference, please press
      star zero on your telephone keypad. As a reminder, this conference is being
      recorded. It is now my pleasure to introduce your host, Mr. Brett Iverson, Vice
      President, Investor Relations. Thank you. You may begin. Good afternoon, and
      thank you for joining us today. On the call with me are Sati Nadella, Chairman
      and Chief Executive Officer, Amy Hood, Chief Financial Officer, Alice Jollett,
      Chief Accounting Officer, and Keith Dolliver, Deputy General Counsel. On the
      Microsoft Invest Relations website, you can find our earnings press release
      and financial summary slide deck, which is intended to supplement our prepared
      remarks during today''s call and provides the reconciliation of differences
      between GAAP and non-GAAP financial measures. On this call, we will discuss
      certain non-GAAP items. The non-GAAP financial measures provided should not
      be considered as a substitute for or superior to the measures of financial performance
      prepared in accordance with GAAP. They''re included as additional clarifying
      items to aid investors in further understanding the company''s first quarter
      performance in addition to the impact these items and events have on the financial
      results. All growth comparisons we make on the call today relate to the corresponding
      period of last year unless otherwise noted. We will also provide growth rates
      in constant currency when available as a framework for assessing how our underlying
      businesses performed, excluding the effect of foreign currency rate fluctuations.
      Where growth rates are the same in constant currency, we will refer to the growth
      rate only. We will post our prepared remarks to our website immediately following
      the call until the complete transcript is available. Today''s call is being
      webcast live and recorded. If you ask a question, it will be included in our
      live transmission, in the transcript, and in any future use of the recording.
      You can replay the call and view the transcript on the Microsoft Investor Relations
      website. During this call, we will be making forward-looking statements, which
      are predictions, projections, or other statements about future events. These
      statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject
      to risks and uncertainties. Actual results could materially differ because of
      factors discussed in today''s earnings press release, in the comments made during
      this conference call, and in the risk factor section of our Form 10-K, Forms
      10-Q, and other reports and filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
      We do not undertake any duty to update any forward-looking statement. And with
      that, I''ll turn the call over to Satya. Thank you, Brett. To start, I want
      to outline the principles that are guiding us through these changing economic
      times. First, we will invest behind categories that will drive the long-term
      secular trend where digital technology as a percentage of world''s GDP will
      continue to increase. Second, we''ll prioritize helping our customers get the
      most value out of their digital spend so that they can do more with less. And
      finally, we will be disciplined in managing our cost structure. With that context,
      this quarter, the Microsoft Cloud again exceeded $25 billion in quarterly revenue,
      up 24% and 31% in constant currency. And based on current trends continuing,
      we expect our broader commercial business to grow at around 20% in constant
      currency this fiscal year as we manage through the cyclical trends affecting
      our consumer business. With that, let me highlight our progress starting with
      Azure. Moving to the cloud is the best way for organizations to do more with
      less today. It helps them align their spend with demand and mitigate risk around
      increasing energy costs and supply chain constraints. We''re also seeing more
      customers turn to us to build and innovate with infrastructure they already
      have. With Azure Arc, organizations like Wells Fargo can run Azure services,
      including containerized applications across on-premises, edge, and multi-cloud
      environments. We now have more than 8,500 customers, more than double the number
      a year ago. We are the platform of choice for customers'' SAP workloads in the
      cloud. Companies like Chobani, Munich Re, Sodexo, Volvo Cars all run SAP on
      Azure. We are the only cloud provider with direct and secure access to Oracle
      databases running in Oracle Cloud infrastructure, making it possible for companies
      like FedEx, GE, and Marriott to use capabilities from both companies. And with
      Azure Confidential Computing, we''re enabling companies in highly regulated
      industries, including RBC, to bring their most sensitive applications to the
      cloud. Just last week, UBS said it''ll move more than 50% of its applications
      to Azure. Now to data and AI. With our Microsoft Intelligent Data Platform,
      we provide a complete data fabric helping customers cut integration tax associated
      with bringing together siloed solutions. Customers like Mercedes-Benz are standardizing
      on our data stack to process and govern massive amounts of data. Cosmos DB is
      the go-to database powering the world''s most demanding workloads at limitless
      scale. Cosmos DB now supports PostgreSQL, making Azure the first cloud provider
      to offer a database service that supports both relational and NoSQL workloads.
      And in AI, we are turning the world''s most advanced models into platforms for
      customers. Earlier this month, we brought the power of Dolly to Azure OpenAI
      service, helping customers like Mattel apply the breakthrough image generation
      model to commercial use cases for the first time. And Azure Machine Learning
      provides industry-leading ML apps, helping organizations like 3M deploy, manage,
      and govern models. All-up Azure ML revenue has increased more than 100% for
      four quarters in a row. Now on to developers. We have the most complete platform
      for developers to build cloud-native applications. Four years since our acquisition,
      GitHub is now at $1 billion in annual recurring revenue. And GitHub''s developer-first
      ethos has never been stronger. More than 90 million people now use the service
      to build software for any cloud on any platform, up three times. GitHub Advanced
      Security is helping organizations improve their security posture by bringing
      features directly into the developer''s workflow. Toyota North America chose
      the offering this quarter to help its developers build and secure many of its
      most critical applications. Now on to Power Platform. We are helping customers
      save time and money with our end-to-end suite spanning low-code, no-code tools,
      robotic process automation, virtual agents, and business intelligence. Power
      BI is the market leader in business intelligence in the cloud and is growing
      faster than competition as companies like Walmart standardize on the tool for
      reporting and analytics. PowerApps is the market leader in low-code, no-code
      tools and has nearly 15 million monthly active users, up more than 50% compared
      to a year ago. Power Automate has more than 7 million monthly active users and
      is being used by companies like Brown Foreman, Komatsu, MaaS, T-Mobile to digitize
      manual business processes and save thousands of hours of employee time. And
      we''re going further with new AI powered capabilities and power automate that
      turn natural language into advanced workflows. Now on to Dynamics 365. From
      customer experience and service to finance and supply chain, we continue to
      take share across all categories we serve. For example, Lifthansa Cargo chose
      us to centralize customer information and related shipments. CBRE is optimizing
      its field service operations, gaining cost efficiencies. Darden is using our
      solutions to increase both guest frequency and spend at its restaurants, and
      Tillamook is scaling its growth and improving supply chain visibility. All up,
      more than 400,000 organizations now use our business applications. Now on to
      industry solutions. We are seeing increased adoption of our industry and cross-industry
      clouds. Bank of Queensland chose our cloud for financial services to deliver
      new digital experiences for its customers. Our cloud for sustainability is off
      to a fast start as organizations like Telstra use the solution to track their
      environmental footprint. New updates provide insights on hard-to-measure Scope
      3 carbon emissions, and we are seeing record growth in healthcare driven in
      part by our nuanced Dax ambient intelligence solutions, which automatically
      documents patient encounters at the point of care. Physicians tell us Dax dramatically
      improves their productivity, and it''s quickly becoming an on-ramp to our broader
      healthcare offerings. Now on to new systems of work. Microsoft 365, Teams, and
      Viva uniquely enable employees to thrive in today''s digitally connected, distributed
      world of work. Microsoft 365 is the CloudFloss platform that supports all the
      ways people work and every type of worker, reducing cost and complexity for
      IT. The new Microsoft 365 app brings together our productivity apps with third-party
      content as well as personalized recommendations. Microsoft Teams is the de facto
      standard for collaboration and has become essential to how hundreds of millions
      of people meet, call, chat, collaborate, and do business. As we emerge from
      the pandemic, we are retaining users we''ve gained and are seeing increased
      engagement too. Users interact with Teams 1,500 times per month on average.
      In a typical day, the average commercial user spends more time in Teams chat
      than they do in email, and the number of users who use four or more features
      within Teams increased over 20% year-over-year. Teams is becoming a ubiquitous
      platform for business process. Monthly active enterprise users running third
      party and custom applications within Teams increased nearly 60% year over year,
      and over 55% of our enterprise customers who use Teams today also buy Teams
      Rooms or Teams Phone. Teams Phone provides the best in class calling. PSTN users
      have grown by double digits for five quarters in a row. We''re bringing Teams
      rooms to a growing hardware ecosystem, including Cisco''s devices and peripherals,
      which will now run Teams natively. And we''re creating a new category with Microsoft
      Places to help organizations evolve and manage their space for hybrid and in-person
      work. Just like Outlook Calendar orchestrates when people can meet and collaborate,
      Places will do the same for wear. We also announced Teams Premium, addressing
      enterprise demands for advanced meeting features like additional security options
      and intelligent meeting recaps. All this innovation is driving growth across
      Microsoft 365. Leaders in every industry, from Fannie Mae and Lander Lakes to
      Robobank, continue to turn to our Premium E5 offerings for advanced security,
      compliance, voice, and analytics. We''ve also built a completely new suite for
      our employee experience platform, Microsoft Viva, which now has more than 20
      million monthly active users at companies like Finstra, SES, and Unilever. And
      we''re extending Viva to meet role-specific needs. Viva Sales is helping salespeople
      at companies like Adobe, Crayon, and PwC reclaim their time by bringing customer
      interactions across Teams and Outlook directly into their CRM system. Now on
      to Windows. Despite the drop in PC shipments during the quarter, Windows continues
      to see usage growth. All up, there are nearly 20% more monthly active Windows
      devices than pre-pandemic. And on average, Windows 10 and Windows 11 users are
      spending 8.5% more time on their PCs than they were two and a half years ago.
      And we are seeing larger commercial deployments of Windows 11. Accenture, for
      example, has deployed Windows 11 to more than 450,000 employees'' PCs, up from
      just 25,000 seven months ago. And L''Oreal has deployed the operating system
      to 85,000 employees. Now to security. Security continues to be a top priority
      for every organization. We''re the only company with integrated end-to-end tools
      spanning security, compliance, identity, and device management and privacy across
      all clouds and platforms. More than 860,000 organizations across every industry
      from BP and Fujifilm to ING Bank, iHeartMedia, and Lumen Technologies now use
      our security solutions up 33% year-over-year. They can save up to 60% when they
      consolidate our security stack and the number of customers with more than four
      workloads have increased 50% year over year. More organizations are choosing
      both our XDR and cloud native SIM to secure their entire digital estate. The
      number of E5 customers who also purchased Sentinel increased 44% year over year.
      And as threats become more sophisticated, we are innovating to protect customers.
      New capabilities in Defender help secure the entire DevOps lifecycle and manage
      security posture across clouds. And Entra now provides comprehensive identity
      governance for both on-premise and cloud-based user directories. Now on to LinkedIn.
      We once again saw record engagement among our more than 875 million members
      with international growth increasing at nearly 2x the pace as in the United
      States. There are now more than 150 million subscriptions to newsletters on
      LinkedIn, up 4x year over year. New integrations between Viva and LinkedIn Learning
      help companies invest in their existing employees by providing access to courses
      directly in the flow of work. Members added 365 million skills to their profiles
      over the last 12 months, up 43% year over year. And with our acquisition of
      Edubright, they will also soon be able to earn professional certificates from
      trusted partners directly on the platform. We launched the next generation sales
      navigator this quarter, helping sellers increase win rates and deal sizes by
      better understanding and evaluating customer interest. Finally, LinkedIn marketing
      solution continues to provide leading innovation and ROI in B2B digital advertising.
      More broadly, with Microsoft advertising, we offer a trusted platform for any
      marketeer or advertiser looking to innovate. We''ve expanded our geographies
      we serve by nearly 4X over the past year. We are seeing record daily usage of
      Edge, Start, and Bing driven by Windows. Edge is the fastest growing browser
      on Windows and continues to gain share as people use built-in coupon price comparison
      features to save money. We surfaced more than $2 billion in savings to date,
      and this quarter we brought our shopping tools to 15 new markets. Users of our
      start personalized content feed are consuming 2x more content compared to a
      year ago, and we''re also expanding our third-party ad inventory. Netflix will
      launch its first ad-supported subscription plan next month, exclusively powered
      by our technology and sales. And with PromoteIQ, we offer an omnichannel media
      platform for retailers like the Auto Group looking to generate additional revenue
      while maintaining ownership of their own data and customer relationships. Now
      onto gaming. We''re adding new gamers to our ecosystem as we execute on our
      ambition to reach players wherever and whenever they want on any device. We
      saw usage growth across all platforms driven by the strength of console. PC
      Game Pass subscriptions increased 159% year over year. And with cloud gaming,
      we''re transforming how games are distributed, played, and viewed. More than
      20 million people have used the service to stream games to date. And we are
      adding support for new devices like handhelds from Logitech and Razer, as well
      as MetaQuest. And as we look towards the holidays, we offer the best value in
      gaming with Game Pass and Xbox Series S. Nearly half of the Series S buyers
      are new to our ecosystem. In closing, in a world facing increasing headwinds,
      digital technology is the ultimate tailwind. And we''re innovating across the
      entire tech stack to help every organization while also focusing intensely on
      our operational excellence and execution discipline. With that, I''ll hand it
      over to Amy. Thank you, Satya. And good afternoon, everyone. Our first quarter
      revenue was $50.1 billion, up 11% and 16% in constant currency. Earnings per
      share was $2.35 and increased 4% and 11% in constant currency when adjusted
      for the net tax benefit for the first quarter of fiscal year 22. Driven by strong
      execution in a dynamic environment, we delivered a solid start to our fiscal
      year in line with our expectations, even as we saw many of the macro trends
      from the end of the fourth quarter continue to weaken through Q1. In our consumer
      business, PC market demand further deteriorated in September, which impacted
      our Windows OEM and Surface businesses. And reductions in customer advertising
      spend, which also weakened later in the quarter, impacted search and news advertising
      and LinkedIn marketing solutions. As you heard from Satya, in our commercial
      business, we saw strong overall demand for our Microsoft Cloud offerings with
      growth of 31% in constant currency, as well as share gains across many businesses.
      Commercial bookings declined 3% and increased 16% in constant currency on a
      flat expiry base. Excluding the FX impact, growth was driven by strong renewal
      execution, and we continued to see growth in the number of large long-term Azure
      and Microsoft 365 contracts across all deal sizes. More than half of the $10
      million-plus Microsoft 365 bookings came from E5. Commercial remaining performance
      obligation increased 31% and 34% in constant currency to $180 billion. Roughly
      45% will be recognized in revenue in the next 12 months, up 23% year-over-year.
      The remaining portion, which we recognize beyond the next 12 months, increased
      38% year-over-year. And our annuity mix increased one point year-over-year to
      96%. FX impacted company results in line with expectations, with the stronger
      U.S. dollar, FX decreased total company revenue by five points. And at the segment
      level, FX decreased productivity and business processes and intelligent cloud
      revenue growth by six points and more personal computing revenue growth by three
      points. Additionally, FX decreased COGS and operating expense growth by three
      points. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage increased roughly two points
      year over year to 73%, excluding the impact of the change in accounting estimate
      for useful lives, Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage decreased roughly
      one point, driven by sales mixed shift to Azure, and lower Azure margin, primarily
      due to higher energy cost. Company gross margin dollars increased 9% and 16%
      in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly year over
      year to 69%. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate,
      gross margin percentage decreased roughly three points, driven by sales mixed
      shift to Cloud, the lower Azure margin noted earlier, and Nuance. Operating
      expense increased 15% and 18% in constant currency, driven by investments in
      cloud engineering, LinkedIn, Nuance, and commercial sales. At a total company
      level, headcount grew 22% year over year, as we continue to invest in key areas
      just mentioned, as well as customer deployment. Headcount growth included roughly
      six points from the Nuance and Zander acquisitions, which closed last Q3 and
      Q4 respectively. Operating income increased 6% and 15% in constant currency,
      and operating margins decreased roughly two points year over year to 43%. Excluding
      the impact of the change in accounting estimate, operating margins declined
      roughly four points year over year, driven by sales makeshift to cloud, unfavorable
      FX impact, nuance, and the lower Azure margin noted earlier. Now to our segment
      results. Revenue from productivity and business processes was $16.5 billion
      and grew 9% and 15% in constant currency ahead of expectations, with better
      than expected results in office commercial and LinkedIn. Office commercial revenue
      grew 7% and 13% in constant currency. Office 365 commercial revenue increased
      11% and 17% in constant currency, slightly better than expected, with the strong
      renewal execution noted earlier. Growth was driven by install-based expansion
      across all workloads and customer segments, as well as higher ARPU from E5.
      Demand for security, compliance, and voice value in Microsoft 365 drove strong
      E5 momentum again this quarter. Paid Office 365 commercial seats grew 14% year-over-year,
      driven by our small and medium business and frontline worker offerings, although
      we saw a continued impact of new deal moderation outside of E5. Office consumer
      revenue grew 7% and 11% in constant currency, driven by continued momentum in
      Microsoft 365 subscriptions, which grew 13% to $61.3 million. Dynamics revenue
      grew 15% and 22% in constant currency, driven by Dynamics 365, which grew 24%
      and 32% in constant currency. LinkedIn revenue increased 17% and 21% in constant
      currency, ahead of expectations, driven by better than expected growth in talent
      solutions, partially offset by weakness in marketing solutions from the advertising
      trends noted earlier. Segment growth margin dollars increased 11% and 18% in
      constant currency, and gross margin percentage increased roughly one point year
      over year. Excluding the impact of the latest change in accounting estimate,
      gross margin percentage decreased slightly, driven by sales mixed shift to cloud
      offerings. operating expense increased 13% and 16% in constant currency, and
      operating income increased 10% and 19% in constant currency, including four
      points due to the latest change in accounting estimate. Next, the intelligent
      cloud segment. Revenue was $20.3 billion, increasing 20% and 26% in constant
      currency in line with expectations. Overall, Server products and cloud services
      revenue increased 22% and 28% in constant currency. Azure and other cloud services
      revenue grew 35% and 42% in constant currency, about a point lower than expected,
      driven by the continued moderation in Azure consumption growth as we help customers
      optimize current workloads while they prioritize new workloads. In our per-user
      business, the enterprise mobility and security install base grew 18%, to over
      232 million seats with continued impact from the new deal moderation noted earlier.
      In our on-premises server business, revenue was flat, an increase 4% in constant
      currency, slightly ahead of expectations, driven by hybrid demand, including
      better than expected annuity purchasing ahead of the SQL Server 2022 launch.
      Enterprise services revenue grew 5% and 10% in constant currency, driven by
      enterprise support services. Segment gross margin dollars increased 20% and
      26% in constant currency, and gross margin percentage decreased slightly. Excluding
      the impact with the latest change in accounting estimate, gross margin percentage
      declined roughly three points, driven by sales makeshift to Azure and higher
      energy costs impacting Azure margins. Operating expenses increased 25% and 28%
      in constant currency, including roughly eight points of impact from Nuance.
      and operating income grew 17% and 25% in constant currency, with roughly nine
      points of favorable impact from the latest change in accounting estimate. Now
      to more personal computing. Revenue decreased slightly year over year to $13.3
      billion and grew 3% in constant currency, in line with expectations overall,
      but with OEM and surface weakness offset by upside in gaming consoles. Windows
      OEM revenue decreased 15% year-over-year. Excluding the impact from the Windows
      11 deferral last year, revenue declined to 20%, driven by PC market demand deterioration
      noted earlier. Devices revenue grew 2% and 8% in constant currency, in line
      with expectations, driven by the impact of a large HoloLens deal, partially
      offset by low double-digit declines in consumer surface sales. Windows commercial
      products and cloud services revenue grew 8% and 15% in constant currency, in
      line with expectations driven by demand from Microsoft 365 E5 noted earlier.
      Search and news advertising revenue, XTAC, increased 16% and 21% in constant
      currency, in line with expectations, benefiting from an increase in search volumes
      and roughly five points of impact from Xandr, even as we saw increased ad market
      headwinds during September. Edge browser gained share again this quarter. And
      in gaming, revenue grew slightly and was up 4% in constant currency, ahead of
      expectations, driven by better than expected console sales. Xbox hardware revenue
      grew 13% and 19% in constant currency. Xbox content and services revenue declined
      3% and increased 1% in constant currency, driven by declines in first-party
      content as well as in third-party content, where we had lower engagement hours
      and higher monetization, partially offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscriptions.
      Segment gross margin dollars declined 9% and 4% in constant currency, and gross
      margin percentage decreased roughly five points year over year, driven by sales
      makeshift to lower margin businesses. Operating expenses increased 2% and 5%
      in constant currency, driven by the Zander acquisition. And operating income
      decreased 15% and 9% in constant currency. Now back to total company results.
      Capital expenditures, including finance leases, were $6.6 billion, and cash
      paid for PP&E was $6.3 billion. Our data center investments continue to be based
      on strong customer demand and usage signals. Cash flow from operations was $23.2
      billion, down 5% year-over-year, driven by strong cloud billings and collections,
      which were more than offset by a tax payment related to the transfer of intangible
      property completed in Q1 of FY22. Free cash flow was $16.9 billion, down 10%
      year-over-year. Excluding the impact of this tax payment, cash flow from operations
      grew 2%, and free cash flow was relatively unchanged for the year. This quarter,
      other income and expense was $54 million, driven by interest income, which was
      mostly offset by interest expense and net losses on foreign currency remeasurement.
      Our effective tax rate was approximately 19%. And finally, we returned $9.7
      billion to shareholders through share repurchases and dividends. Now, moving
      to our Q2 outlook, which, unless specifically noted otherwise, is on a U.S.
      dollar basis. My commentary... for both the full year and next quarter does
      not include any impact from Activision, which we still expect to close by the
      end of the fiscal year. First, FX. With the stronger U.S. dollar and based on
      current rates, we now expect FX to decrease total revenue growth by approximately
      five points and to decrease total COGS and operating expense growth by approximately
      three points. Within the segments, we anticipate roughly seven points of negative
      FX impact on revenue growth and productivity and business processes, six points
      in intelligent cloud, and three points in more personal computing. Our outlook
      has many of the trends we saw at the end of Q1 continue into Q2. In our consumer
      business, materially weaker PC demand from September will continue and impact
      both Windows OEM and Surface device results, even as the Windows install base
      and usage grows, as you heard from Satya. Additionally, customers focusing their
      advertising spend will impact LinkedIn and search and news advertising revenue.
      In our commercial business, demand for our differentiated hybrid and cloud offerings,
      together with consistent execution, should drive healthy growth across the Microsoft
      Cloud. In commercial bookings, continued strong execution across core annuity
      sales motions and commitments to our platform should drive solid growth on a
      moderately growing expiry base against a strong prior year comparable, which
      included a significant volume of large long-term Azure contracts. As a reminder,
      the growing mix of larger long-term Azure contracts, which are more unpredictable
      in their timing, always drives increased quarterly volatility in our bookings
      growth rate. Microsoft Cloud gross margin percentage should be up roughly one
      point year over year, driven by the latest accounting estimate change noted
      earlier. Excluding that impact, Q2 gross margin percentage will decrease roughly
      two points driven by lower Azure margin, primarily due to higher energy costs,
      revenue mix shift to Azure, and the impact from Nuance. In capital expenditures,
      we expect a sequential increase on a dollar basis, with normal quarterly spend
      variability in the timing of our cloud infrastructure build-out. Next, to segment
      guidance. In productivity and business processes, we expect revenue to grow
      between 11 and 13% in constant currency, or 16.6 to 16.9 billion U.S. dollars.
      In office commercial, revenue growth will again be driven by Office 365, with
      seat growth across customer segments, and ARP growth through E5. We expect Office
      365 revenue growth to be similar to last quarter on a constant currency basis.
      In our on-premises business, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid
      30s. In office consumer, we expect revenue to decline low to mid single digits
      as Microsoft 365 subscription growth will be more than offset by unfavorable
      FX impact. For LinkedIn, we expect continued strong engagement on the platform
      although results will be impacted by a slowdown in advertising spend and hiring,
      resulting in mid-to-high single-digit revenue growth or low-to-mid-teens growth
      in constant currency. And in dynamics, we expect revenue growth in the low double
      digits or the low 20s in constant currency, driven by continued share gains
      in Dynamics 365. For Intelligent Cloud, we expect revenue to grow between 22
      and 24% in constant currency, or 21.25 to 21.55 billion U.S. dollars. Revenue
      will continue to be driven by Azure, which, as a reminder, can have quarterly
      variability primarily from our per-user business and from in-period revenue
      recognition, depending on the mix of contracts. We expect Azure revenue growth
      to be sequentially lower by roughly five points, on a constant currency basis.
      Azure revenue will continue to be driven by strong growth and consumption with
      some impact from the Q1 trends noted earlier. And our per-user business should
      continue to benefit from Microsoft 365 Suite momentum, though we expect moderation
      in growth rate given the size of the installed base. In our on-premises server
      business, we expect revenue to decline low single digits as demand for our hybrid
      solutions, including strong annuity purchasing from the SQL Server 2022 launch,
      will be more than offset by unfavorable FX impact. And in enterprise services,
      we expect revenue growth to be in the low single digits driven by enterprise
      support. In more personal computing, we expect revenue of $14.5 to $14.9 billion.
      In Windows OEM, we expect revenue to decline in the high 30s, Excluding the
      impact from the Windows 11 revenue deferral last year, revenue would decline
      mid-30s, reflecting both PC market demand and a strong prior year comparable,
      particularly in the commercial segment. In devices, revenue should decline approximately
      30%, again, roughly in line with the PC market. In Windows commercial products
      and cloud services, customer demand for Microsoft 365 and our advanced security
      solutions should drive growth in the mid-single digits or low double digits
      in constant currency. Search and news advertising, XTAC, should grow in the
      low to mid-teens roughly six points faster than overall search and news advertising
      revenue, driven by growing first-party revenue and the inclusion of Xandr. And
      in gaming, we expect revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens against a strong
      prior year comparable. That included several first-party title launches, partially
      offset by growth in Xbox Game Pass subscribers. We expect Xbox content and services
      revenue to decline in the low to mid-teens. Now, back to company guidance. We
      expect COGS to grow between 6% and 7% in constant currency, or to be between
      $17.4 and $17.6 billion. And operating expense to grow between 17% and 18% in
      constant currency, or to be between $14.3% and $14.4 billion. As we continue
      to focus our investment in key growth areas, total headcount growth sequentially
      should be minimal. Other income and expense should be roughly $100 million as
      interest income is expected to more than offset interest expense. Further FX
      and equity movements through Q2 are not reflected in this number. And as a reminder,
      we are required to recognize mark-to-market gains or losses on our equity portfolio
      which can increase quarterly volatility. And we expect our Q2 effective tax
      rate to be between 19% and 20%. And finally, as a reminder for Q2 cash flow,
      we expect to make a $2.4 billion cash tax payment related to the capitalization
      of R&D provision enacted in 2017 TCJA and effective as of July 1, 2022. Now
      some thoughts on the full fiscal year. First, FX. Based on current rates, we
      now expect a roughly five-point headwind to full-year revenue growth. And FX
      should decrease COGS and operating expense growth by approximately three points.
      At the total company level, we continue to expect double-digit revenue and operating
      income growth on a constant currency basis. Revenue will be driven by around
      20% constant currency growth in our commercial business. proven by strong demand
      for our Microsoft Cloud offerings. That growth will be partially offset by the
      increased declines we now see in the PC market. With the high margins in our
      Windows OEM business and the cyclical nature of the PC market, we take a long-term
      approach to investing in our core strategic growth areas and maintain these
      investment levels regardless of PC market conditions. Therefore, With our first
      quarter results and lower expected OEM revenue for the remainder of the year,
      as well as over $800 million of greater than expected energy costs, we now expect
      operating margins in U.S. dollars to be down roughly a point year over year.
      On a constant currency basis, excluding the incremental impact of the lower
      Windows OEM revenue and the favorable impact of the latest accounting change,
      we continue to expect FY23 operating margins to be roughly flat year over year.
      In closing, in this environment, it is more critical than ever to continue to
      invest in our strategic growth markets, such as cloud security teams, Dynamics
      365, and LinkedIn, where we have opportunities to continue to gain share as
      we provide problem-solving innovations to our customers. And while we continue
      to help our customers do more with less, we will do the same internally. And
      you should expect to see our operating expense growth moderate materially through
      the year while we focus on growing productivity of the significant headcount
      investments we''ve made over the last year. With that, let''s go to Q&A. Brett?
      Thanks, Amy. We''ll now move over to Q&A. Out of respect for others on the call,
      we request that participants please ask only one question. Jesse, can you please
      repeat your instructions? Absolutely. If you would like to ask a question, please
      press star 1 on your telephone keypad at this time. The confirmation tone will
      indicate that your line is in the question queue. You may press star 2 if you
      would like to remove your question from the queue. For participants using speaker
      equipment, it may be necessary to pick up your handset before pressing the star
      keys. Our first question is coming from the line of Keith Weiss with Morgan
      Stanley. Please proceed with your question. Excellent. Thank you guys for taking
      the question. impressive results in what''s obviously a very difficult environment.
      A question for Amy, and it pains me to ask a question about a percentage point,
      but I think this is what''s on a lot of investors'' minds, is this is two quarters
      in a row now where Azure constant currency growth came in a little bit below
      your guidance. And I think what investors are worrying about or sort of wondering
      about is, is there an inherent volatility in that business that''s just harder
      to forecast? And on a go-forward basis, How should we think about that forecast?
      Have you applied more conservatism in it? And how should we think about Azure
      growth like the glide path for the whole year? If you could address those, I
      think it would put a lot of investor minds at ease. Thanks, Keith. And I do
      appreciate you asking about that one point because I do know it is a point of
      focus every quarter. And what I would say is there is some inherent volatility
      to that number. a point here or there. You''ve heard me say it when we''ve been
      a point better, and you''ve heard me say it when we''ve been a point worse.
      And I want to focus mostly on what and how we see the number, which is that
      it is still a very large growth rate with growth across all segments and with
      growth across all geos that was, to the question, generally in line with where
      we expected. And what we did see through the quarter is a real focus both by
      customers, but also by our sales and customer success teams on going proactively
      to customers and making sure we are helping them optimize their workloads. And
      as we went through the quarter, and as of course macroeconomic environment got
      more complicated, we continued to focus on that because ultimately those optimizations
      bring value. Even as budgets are still growing, And budgeted spend is still
      growing. So it''s this nuance of you''re still seeing digitization. This is
      still the tailwind that helps customers solve problems. This is still the way
      to build growth and leverage in your business. And yet, you still want to optimize
      your workloads. You still want to run them the most efficiently so that you
      can then make room for new workload growth. We saw that across all segments.
      If there was one segment \u2013 Where I may have seen it a bit more, I would
      say, in the small or mid-sized segment of the market, that tends to be more
      through partner. We rely on partners to help customers do those same optimizations
      and prepare workloads. But it is that one point I know that people are focused
      on. But if you step back and say that this is how you drive ultimate share gains
      and build customer loyalty and help customers grow, I think that needs to be
      the focus. of our teams inside the company and also the partners that we rely
      on to help customers do that as well. And so as I look forward, there is some
      inherent volatility to this number. And here I think you will hear us talk about
      continuing to invest to make that happen, whether it''s in customer success,
      whether it''s in optimizations, whether it''s frankly in engineering to help
      people be able to even have better solutions to optimize against. So I do think
      that will remain top of mind for us, even as this remains probably the most
      exciting opportunity in TAM across infra, data, and AI that exists in technology.
      I don''t know, Satya, if you want. Yeah, I mean, I think that that''s the only
      thing I would add, Amy, to your point is that obviously our investment profile
      here is that this is the largest TAM where we, on a large number, have good
      growth rates with the kind of volatility you''re seeing. So we''re going to
      stay focused on it. And in this particular period, I think we are going to optimize
      for long-term customer loyalty by proactively helping them optimize their spend,
      which I think is the right thing for us to be doing as a company for on behalf
      of our shareholders long-term. Outstanding. Thank you, guys. Thanks, Keith.
      Jessie, next question, please. Our next question comes from Mark Mordler with
      Bernstein Research. Please proceed with your question. Thank you. I''d like
      to follow up on the last question on Azure specifically. So next quarter, you''re
      guiding to sequential further slowing in the business. Is that the factor of
      optimization? Is it something else that''s going on in here? How should we think
      about that specific component of the guidance, given the fact that you''ve got,
      you know, good bookings, strong RPO growth, etc.? ? Thanks, Mark. You''re right.
      And let me go ahead and reiterate part of that, which is that this quarter,
      as you saw, we did have very good bookings growth. And within the RPO number
      that you''re referring to, we had what we would call long-dated growth, which
      means we''re having and seeing customers continue to sign commitments to the
      platform. And that goes really to what Satya mentioned, is that the plans to
      invest here remain intact. And so it''s about both the optimization that you''re
      talking about, and we are seeing, and the guide includes that, and it also includes
      new workloads starting. And those also may not be matched up one-to-one to see
      sort of a consistent pattern. And that does result in some volatility. The other
      piece of it, Mark, that we didn''t talk on before, because I was really focused
      on consumption, is that there is per-user headwinds as well, right, because
      we''re getting and seeing some of these laws of large numbers in terms of the
      per-seat business. So there''s a couple of things going on here, Mark, against,
      as you said, a very large base. So it''s not just the optimization to new workloads.
      It''s also some per-user work as well. Okay. Thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks,
      Mark. Jesse, next question, please. The next question is from Brent Till with
      Jefferies. Please proceed with your question. Amy, last quarter you called out
      for the first time SMB weakness. It sounds like that continued. I think many
      are questioning if did that get worse this quarter, and did you see it filter
      now into the enterprise? Can you talk about what you''re seeing higher up above
      SMB? Thanks, Brent. Maybe this is a chance to talk a little bit about Microsoft
      365. I think that''s a place where We can talk specifically about the SMB market
      because we did see continued impact there in Q1, although it was not different
      than what we saw, frankly, in Q4. In Microsoft 365, what you saw was very good
      renewal execution. And it speaks to, I think, the value people are seeing in
      Microsoft 365. on-time renewals that were frankly better in Q1 based on expirations
      than we''d seen a year ago. So deals are both getting done and I think getting
      done on time. They''re getting done within a discount range that we feel good
      about that''s consistent. And we saw a good upsell to E5. So if you think about
      that as sort of forming the basis of what are we seeing above SMB, that''s a
      good summary. Where we, in fact, saw, I think we talked about it, new deal moderation,
      I''d refer to that, frankly, in Q4 as well. It tended to be in, to your point,
      the smaller end of the market, small to mid-sized companies. And it also tended
      to be through partner, which we had talked about before, Brent, a little bit,
      and I''d refer to. And it tended to be around selling what is, in fact, some
      new value that we''ve put into E3. So this is a place where there is some macro
      impact, but there''s also, I think, a better job we can do in our E3 SKU, which
      is really a core value proposition. We added a lot of value to that SKU in Q4
      in terms of security and auto-patching for Windows. It''s a great value in the
      same way E5 is. We land the E5 really well. We''ve got some work to do on landing
      E3. So there is some macro. It seems pretty consistent, frankly, more than inconsistent
      with what we saw. And there is some execution that I think, frankly, we can
      get better at as well. Thank you. Thanks, Brent. Jessie, next question, please.
      Our next question is coming from Mark Murphy with J.P. Morgan. Please proceed
      with your question. Yes, thank you very much. Satya, this quarter we''re seeing
      an inflection in many of your AI breakthroughs, thinking of GitHub Copilot and
      the image generation in your designer product. What is it that''s enabling you
      to innovate so rapidly and essentially to be first to market? I''m wondering
      if it''s the open AI relationship or maybe some of your inferencing capabilities
      or something else. And then as a quick follow-up, Amy, you did mention the lower
      margins in Azure due to the higher energy costs. Are you inferring that we can
      kind of dimensionalize that incremental impact at something like $200 million
      per quarter? And then is there anything you can do to try to manage that through
      this period? Thanks for the question. First, yes, the OpenAI partnership is
      a very critical partnership for us. Perhaps it''s sort of important to call
      out that we built The supercomputing capability inside of Azure, which is highly
      differentiated, the way computing, the network in particular, come together
      in order to support these large-scale training of these platform models or foundation
      models has been very critical. That''s what''s driven, in fact, the progress
      OpenAI has been making. And, of course, we then productize it, you know, as
      part of Azure OpenAI services. And that''s what we''re seeing, quote, be used
      by our own first-party applications, whether it''s the GitHub Copilot or Designer,
      even inside Batch. And then, of course, the third-party like Mattel. And so
      we''re very excited about that. We have a lot sort of more sort of talk about
      when it comes to GitHub Universe. I think you''ll see more advances on the GitHub
      Copilot, which is off to a fantastic start. But overall, this is an area of
      huge investment. The AI moment clearly has arrived. And it''s going to be part
      of every product, whether it''s, in fact, you mentioned our power platform,
      because that''s another area where we''re innovating in terms of corporate all
      of these AI models. So, yeah, so I think AI is a place where I think we have
      differentiated capability at the infrastructure layer for training and inference.
      And the models themselves are platforms for third parties. And our first-party
      applications are getting better because of the use of those AI models. And to
      your question on energy costs, let me try to provide a little bit of help there.
      We did not see as big of that. As I said, it''s over 800 for the year. Some
      of that was in Q1, but the majority of it will be in Q2 through 4. And I think
      if you want to think about it as somewhere, you know, 250-ish a quarter. It''s
      not exact, but that would be a decent assumption for the remainder of the year.
      Thank you. Thanks, Mark. Jessie, next question, please. Our next question is
      coming from the line of Carl Keirstead with UBS. Please proceed with your question.
      Okay, great. Amy, I''d love to just ask you around margins. Clearly, you''re
      experiencing a little bit more sales mix given the weakness on the Windows side.
      It looks like you''ve elected not to throttle back OpEx to enable you to meet
      the three months ago guidance for flat margins, so they''ll now drift a little
      bit lower. Do you mind talking through that decisions? Why not throttle back
      OPEX as a counter to that Windows pressure? Thanks, Carl. And I shared a little
      bit on the call, but let me share a little more because I think it''s important
      in terms of how we think about investment and continuing to invest where we''re
      seeing substantial opportunity and growth. You know, the PC market is cyclical,
      and we had some great benefits for a couple of years during the pandemic, and
      we chose not to spend against that favorability over the past couple years,
      and it fell to the bottom line, and you saw substantially increased margins
      over that time period. And we did that intentionally because it is a cyclical
      market. And so in the same way I see it now is that, you know, are going to
      be a tough headwind for us for the year. But overall, the windows back to the
      install base, our ability to grow usage, it''s still higher than it was. And
      that''s a good opportunity for us. And so in the same way that we let it fall
      to the bottom line when we saw a surge, it''s important to stay consistent in
      this town market. Because when you have the type of opportunity that we have,
      specifically in the commercial business and the tams that satya talked about
      as being some of our most exciting and you have the opportunity with your customers
      to gain share to gain confidence right and i think it''s important to have a
      steady hand now let me also say it is not as though we are not responding to
      the macro environment around cost um as i commented our sequential headcount
      growth from Q1 to Q2 will be minimal. It''ll be about investing where we said
      we would invest, which is in focused areas. It''s about moving headcount to
      make sure inside the company we''ve got it on the highest and most important
      things. We''ve added a lot of headcount over the past 12 months, and we want
      to make sure we use those headcount in the most productive way possible, and
      we''re going to do that. And also, we''re going to, frankly, lapse. some investments
      that we''ve made at the end of H2, Carl. We closed Nuance at the end of Q3.
      We closed Zander in Q4. When we come and lap those, you will see a material
      decline in OpEx investment. You will also see us start to lap some of the headcount
      surges that we made last year in key areas. And by then, I feel good that we''ll
      see productivity improvements from the headcount have in our focus. And so,
      It''s an ability to say, absolutely, I want to stay consistent, and we''ll respond
      to the macro. It''s possible to do both those things, and I think that''s what
      we''re doing. Got it. Thank you. Thanks, Carl. Jessie, next question, please.
      Our next question is coming from Brad Sills with Bank of America. Please proceed
      with your question. Oh, wonderful. Thanks for taking my question. I wanted to
      ask a question about Office Commercial. A lot of the growth here is driven by
      subscriber growth. This quarter, for example, 17% constant currency, subscriber
      growth of 14. Could you remind us where the incremental subscribers coming from?
      Could we see that mix of growth shift away from subscribers towards ASP potentially
      over time? I think you''re already over 300 million subscribers. So just any
      color on just the runway from here, where''s the incremental seed coming from?
      And with all the work that you''re doing with E3, E5 and collaboration security
      analytics, Might we see more of the growth coming from ASP versus subscriber
      growth over time? Thank you so much. Thanks, Brett. It''s a good question because
      you''ve continued to see this seek growth, I think, for actually much longer
      than many of the investors had expected. And it really should continue in some
      ways because we''re focusing on frontline worker scenarios. We''re continuing
      to focus on small and big-size business growth. And we''re adding new things
      to which you can grow. whether that''s Viva, whether it''s Teams, there''s new
      things that enable us to add relevancy, frankly, and then to add value and then
      to add seats. And so I don''t want to say it has to be, again, this vision of
      all. So I think you''ll continue to see lower end seat growth, which is what
      we''ve been seeing. And you will see us continue to focus on the value of E5
      and the E3 skew where we''ve added some value, making sure we can still move
      people to that suite as well. And so you will see, right, over time, long-term,
      the seat growth move a little bit, and then you''ll see ASPs show up. And it
      depends a little bit on VIX, frankly, each quarter. You saw a little more ARPU
      in Q4. You saw a little less in Q1. That had to do with some execution in Q1,
      but I actually think there''s room to do both those things, and I''ve felt that
      way now for a couple of years. Great to hear. Thanks, Amy. Thanks, Fred. Jessie,
      next question, please. Our next question is coming from the line of Greg Moskowitz
      with Mizuho. Please proceed with your question. Okay, thank you. Satya or Amy,
      as a follow-up on Azure, I''m curious how you foresee the magnitude of two different
      variables on cloud computing demand over the near to medium term, the first
      being economic pressures on the willingness of some customers to spend, and
      the second being the impact of the spiking energy costs perhaps as a facilitator
      for something to do more in the cloud. Do you see these as largely offsetting
      factors, or are you expecting the former variable to be a lot more prominent
      than the latter? Thank you. Yeah, I mean, the way we see it is overall macro
      will mean that everybody''s going to optimize their bill. In fact, as Amy said,
      our job number one for large swaths of our sort of even customer-facing organizations
      is to proactively help them optimize. In fact, our incentives in our customer
      success teams are lined up with them helping customers go to do more with less.
      So that''s sort of one side. The thing, though, from a customer perspective,
      the best way for them to align their spend with what is uncertain demand is
      to move to the cloud. So we see the value prop of the cloud. So the big winner
      in all of this will be public cloud because public cloud helps businesses offset
      the risk of taking demand risk. The other side, as you described it, is the
      risk around supply chain or energy costs. And so that''s another one. The best
      way to hedge against any energy cost and be, in fact, more energy efficient
      is to move the cloud. So that''s where I think a little bit of, you know, as
      you all think about what happens to cloud, for us, we look at this and say this
      is a period where clouds are going to gain share. because we''re still in the
      early innings of adoption. And so we just want to invest going into it with
      that mindset and build long-term customer loyalty. Very helpful. Thank you.
      Thanks, Greg. Jessie, we have time for one last question. Thank you. Our final
      question is coming from the line of Brent Braceland with Piper Sandler. Please
      proceed with your question. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking the question here.
      Helpful color on cloud. I wanted to pivot to advertising. This was a segment
      that crossed over $10 billion, I think, earlier this year. Netflix rolling out
      ad-supported model next year, powered by Microsoft. What is the broader Microsoft
      advertising ambitions, maybe three to five years here, given these are very
      large and very profitable segments that Microsoft has not historically focused
      on? Thanks. No, thanks for the question. Our core advertising business has got
      two elements to it. One is I''ll call it the LinkedIn B2B advertising, where
      we clearly have a leadership position around both reach quality of ROI and will
      continue. Of course, it will be cyclically impacted, but we feel that the LinkedIn
      engagement continues to grow. And as that market comes back, our premium position
      with LinkedIn owned and operated, I feel very well positioned. We''ll continue
      to invest in that space. The second point is the place where We are, again,
      very, very focused on first starting with our own owned and operated. So when
      we talk about the overall active devices of Windows have grown by 20% over the
      pandemic. one of the big opportunities it opens up is for us to take our own
      owned and operated inventory, right, whether it is Bing and search, whether
      it''s the feed. And those are things that you see some of the growth. We are
      share takers in the browser. We''re share takers in terms of engagement of the
      feed. And those are things that we are high leverage on top of the install base
      that''s now structurally changed in terms of growth. And then the third party
      with Netflix, we''re really excited about that. And we''re going to look to
      grow our first, you know, make Netflix a successful partner. But we''re going
      to continue to grow our third party business on the ad platform. So those would
      be the three areas. LinkedIn, our own targeted advertising, both search and
      feed, as well as third party ad network. Thanks, Brad. That wraps up the Q&A
      portion of today''s earnings call. Thank you for joining us today, and we look
      forward to speaking with all of you soon. Thank you. Thank you very much. Thank
      you. Ladies and gentlemen, this does conclude today''s teleconference. We thank
